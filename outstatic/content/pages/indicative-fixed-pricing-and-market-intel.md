For 3-21-23

Little to no change in today’s NYMEX from yesterday. CA Basis SHOULD weaken in the coming weeks as scheduled maintenance wraps up, increasing intra state capacity. While we wait for CA Basis to weaken, we can always pick up NYMEX strips (financial) now and buy the matching Basis (physical) strips later when/if they weaken. Think about it…
