For 3-20-23

NYMEX falling further so far this morning. 1-week and 2-week forecasts call for the West to endure below normal temps, keeping California Basis prices elevated for April ’23. As for the rest of the months, we’re seeing $2 increases for July – Sep, and $5 increases for Dec – Feb. The summer and winter basis strips are showing these wide spreads out through 2027. Buy up all the cheap months and cover the pricey months to be safe? Maybe…
