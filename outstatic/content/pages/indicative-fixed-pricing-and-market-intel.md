For 3-27-23

NYMEX fell further today, so far. Just as it looked like the bulls were about to push the bears out for a while, the bears came roaring back this morning, sporting a $0.25 drop from 1 week ago and down a staggering $3.35 from 1 year ago. Weather patterns becoming more favorable with strong production continue to push NYMEX prices down. CA Basis, on the other hand, remains bullish to very bullish. PG&E CG dropped a few cents from last week’s prices, but SoCal CG’s prompt month jumped up over $2. SoCalGas needs to finish up that maintenance and bring back that missing 1.5Bcf of capacity. Funny how SoCalGas allows a bull run going into Bidweek, clearly effecting the price of April First of the Month SoCal CG Index….
