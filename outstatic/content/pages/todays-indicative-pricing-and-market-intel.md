Indicative Fixed Prices are down considerably from Friday’s rally. It seems the fear of cold weather pushed a lot of desks to overbuy and now those positions are coming off hard. Line 235 behind SoCal is said to be coming back online 3-9-23. That news helps push prices, and fear, down.

We could very well see further downturn in pricing here on the western front once capacity increases, weather returns to normal, and hydro relieves some of the forecasted natgas Spring/Summer demand.



Here are some indicatives for 3-6-23
