***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 5-12-23***



****

*Tis the Season to Lock*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX **– NYMEX shot up mid-morning today by as much as $0.15 after spending most of this week on the downside. NYMEX is approximately $0.25 higher than last week this time, and roughly $5.30 cheaper than this time last year. Last summer saw NYMEX prices hit $10.00 so keep that fresh in your mind if you think the $2.50 - $4.00 range is too expensive. Steady production above 100Bcf/D, mild weather forecasts, and below normal demand levels are all to be thanked for keeping NYMEX prices in the current price range, but those same driving factors could reverse direction and push NYMEX prices u quickly. Canadian production is limited as wildfires in Western Canada burn close to 1 million acres. Canadian natgas imports fell as low as 6.7Bcf/D earlier this week. The daily average is 8.5Bcf.



**BASIS** – PG&E CG and SoCal CG prices continue to fall. The next few weeks could be the best buying opportunities for Basis – before summer heat increases the CDDs, before demand from the power generation plants increases, and any unplanned maintenance/downtime/reduced capacity takes place, and pretty much ANYTHING out of the ordinary that will be sure to give support to another Basis bull runs takes place.

**RIG COUNT** – Two weeks ago, the Natural Gas Rig Count grew by 2 rigs for a total of 161 active rigs. Last week’s count fell by 4 rigs for a total of 157 active natgas rigs, up 11 rigs on the year.



**PRODUCTION** – This week’s daily production average comes in at around 100.8Bcf, down 0.9Bcf from previous weeks, and hitting a 3-week low. As we remove nuclear, coal, and export LNG, we’re going to need a lot more than 100Bcf/D to outpace at a level that will limit natgas price volatility.

**DEMAND** – Demand for the next week is forecasted to increase from 91.3Bcf to 91.6Bcf/D. Warmer weather with an increase in CDDs is to blame.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – BEFORE reporting on CA retail power/DASR, we want to address the time it takes to price up retail power here in the Golden State. PG&E, SoCalEd, and SDG&E all require a CISR form (Authorization or Revocation of Authorization to Receive Customer Interval Usage Information) to be completed and submitted by the retail power supplier bidding on your retail power contract. It can take OVER THIRTY DAYS for SoCalEd to provide the necessary interval usage data needed to price up a forward contract. SDG&E and PG&E, I am told, are both slightly less than 30 days. So, if you want to see if your current supplier is giving you the best offer (and I bet they’re not due to the trouble that the potential suppliers must go through to bid on your contracts), let’s jump WAY OUT in front of your termination date on your existing contract, please. Just call us directly and we can go through it together.

Now onto the retail power news – May’s day ahead prices fell from last week’s prices due to natural gas prices falling. CA retail power prices are directly related to natural gas prices as natural gas leads the energy sources when it comes to power up the power plants here in the Peoples Republic of California. So, if natgas is up in price, chances are that retail power prices will be up as well, and vice versa.

**CARBON OFFSETS – **If you are interested in reviewing available carbon offsets to purchase, please contact us directly and we will gladly provide you with our supplier partners’ carbon offset menus. To learn more about carbon offsets, just give us a call.

**CRUDE** – What a difference a week and some good economic forecasts (as inaccurate as they may be) can make. After a strong rally that saw prices jump over $80/barrel, crude prices are now testing the bottom of the market. This we’ve seen prices hang out in the lower 70’s. Could we break below the $70 mark again?

**NUCLEAR** – A new Gallup poll shows support for nuclear energy here in the US is at a 10-year high. Seems people are fed up with paying high prices for unreliable energy sources. Global support is also increasing as we look for better energy security.

**RENEWABLES** – The world has spent $3.8 trillion over the past 10 years to increase renewable energy and we have increased renewable energy usage, worldwide, by a whopping 1%. In the words of the great John Lydon (from their only US tour), “ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated?”

**ITEMS OF INTEREST **– New York state will be the first to ban natural gas in new buildings, starting in 2026, and in 2029 for buildings taller than 7 stories. It will exclude manufacturing facilities, restaurants, hospitals, and even car washes. Natural gas in New York state, for most consumers, remains cheaper than power prices. New York is also the sixth largest consumer of natural gas in the US. So, energy bills for New Yorkers will increase as well as the strain put on that relic, they call their electric grid. Lesson to be learned here – you can’t fix stupid, but you can relocate from it. Just ask all the Floridians with New York accents…

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – NYMEX prices remain well below the historical average. Basis in the West continues to fall. HDDs are all but gone by this time next week. CDDs are minimal right now. Production is strong. Demand will increase as we go into summer and then winter. Now is a good time to do what you need to do - call RFP ES. **\#RFPEnergySolutions**

#### **STORAGE REPORT**

The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 73Bcf. The actual number comes in at 78Bcf. We're now 509Bcf higher than this time last year and 332Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,809Bcf. At 2,141Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. Last year this time saw an injection of 76Bcf while the 5-year average for this time of year is 87Bcf. Midwest and Northeast elevated heating demand is to blame for the below average injection number. Storage levels at the end of injection season (Oct ’23) are forecasted to be at 3.89Tcf.

**WEATHER - **The West warms up substantially over the next two weeks, along with…pretty much the entire US except for Texas. Texas can always use a break from their seasonal <s>sauna</s>

 weather. Summer heat will be here soon enough. As the temperatures increase, we can expect both Basis and NYMEX prices to increase as well.
