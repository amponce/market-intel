***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 5-22-23***

*Major swings in NYMEX*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX **– The EIA has NYMEX set to average $2.91 for 2023. So far, we are averaging anywhere from $0.10 to $0.25 above the estimated 2023 price. The 2024 forecasted average is $3.72. Last TH/FR it looked like we may have come to the end of the prolonged bear run. It seems we’re not done yet with a bearish NYMEX market as prompt month and balance of 2023 tumble as much as $0.15 - $0.20. Weather, demand, production, and LNG exports are a constant threat for a bull run to come out of nowhere. NYMEX prompt month is $0.10 more expensive than one week ago. And compared to 1one year ago, NYMEX prompt is nearly $6.00 CHEAPER.



**BASIS** – PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis continued to fall last week but at a much slower pace than the past few weeks. Summer heat, a seemingly endless maintenance schedule, below normal in-state storage, and a lack of in-state production are all legitimate factors that have sent Basis prices racing up in the past and can easily happen again. In my humble opinion, there is a greater chance of Basis moving up a dollar rather than down a dollar for the foreseeable future. SoCalGas and their little brother, SDG&E, petitioned the CPUC to increase Aliso Canyon storage levels from 41Bcf to 68Bcf. If capacity levels are increased to 68Bcf, we could see some basis price relief during summer months, but I wouldn’t count on the winter months falling in price. Better chance they go up rather than down, regardless of any storage increase at Aliso Canyon.

**RIG COUNT** – Two weeks ago saw a decline in the natgas rig count by 16, leaving us with 141 active natgas rigs. This is the biggest 1 week drop since 2016. Last Friday’s report showed no change from the previous week.



**PRODUCTION** – Production held at around 100Bcf/D this week.

**DEMAND** – Demand for power generation from natural gas this coming summer is expected to be the second highest recorded, behind last year’s summer demand. The forecast for demand, for Summer ’23, is set at 38Bcf/D. And let’s not forget about the growing LNG exports. More LNG terminals are in production and scheduled to export, from later in 2023 through 2028. Over 15 LNG terminal projects are lined up last I saw. Natgas demand will increase, demand will be stretched thin, and anything out of the norm could push prices up dramatically.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – There is another Direct Access lottery taking place next month. Anyone interested in procuring third party supply (locking in a fixed price and getting out of the volatile index market) should contact their utility account rep to enter the lottery. We’ve been receiving more and more retail power RFPs (Requests for Proposal – just in case you weren’t sure what the RFP in RFP Energy Solutions stands for) in the last few months. Shopping around and performing a proper Retail Power (Direct Access) contract is far more labor-intensive than shopping around for a natural gas contract compared to natural gas (a true commodity). For one, prospective suppliers bidding on your business need to submit paperwork to the utility company to view your usage – the utility company can take over a month to release this information. Pricing is far less transparent than natural gas and offers vary greatly in what is covered I the price. If you’re interested in shopping your retail power contract, or simply have questions, a group like RFP ES, who has experience in breaking down contract offers, can be a great benefit to you. Call us.

**CARBON OFFSETS – **If you are** **looking to increase your company’s ESG standing as well as shrinking your carbon footprint, we can help you. Many countries in Europe are now mandating that companies (within their country) increase their ESG standing AND buy X amount of carbon offsets annually. As the White House pushes to lessen greenhouse emissions, you can bet the house that mandates in the US are eventual. Here in California, utility companies are already discussing it for as early as 2025. Think of it this way – you can be told by the government what to do/buy to meet your company’s ESG standing, at the price they tell you, or you can be proactive and choose how you want to increase you ESG standing, how much you want to pay, and exactly how you want to do it.

So….you can either call us to discuss your ESG goals or you can wait for the government to call you. Credits are being given now by the government. Government credits don’t last forever. Contact us directly and we will gladly provide you with our supplier partners’ carbon offset menus. To learn more about carbon offsets, just give us a call.

**CRUDE** – Total inventories are 15% below the 10-year seasonal average. Gasoline and diesel are particularly low for this time of year – a slowing economy and concern over inflation have consumers tightening up usage right now. Producers don’t want to oversupply the market for fear of further downward price pressure. But if we start to see the economy pick up, as well as spending/consumption, we could see a hard bull run since reserves are so low.

**NUCLEAR** – [Powermag.com](http://Powermag.com) had this to say earlier this week, “The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) projects the need for about an additional 550 GW to 770 GW of clean, firm capacity. With few viable options for clean baseload generation, the DoE estimates 200 GW or more of demand for new nuclear, both big box and small modular reactors (SMRs). Given the growth of intermittent renewables and rise in electricity demand, nuclear energy could be the critical means to “keeping the lights on” by providing secure, reliable, and standalone 24/7 carbon-free energy.” You want clean energy at an affordable rate, as well as dependable? Look no further.

**RENEWABLES** – The world has been waiting and waiting and waiting for Solar and Wind to provide any significant impact to power generation, and we continue to wait. We’re bored with you, S&W. Those of us paying attention have long realized S&W is not the solution, not even close – it’s unreliable. It’s expensive to manufacture/transport/operate. Most of it will never generate enough energy with S&W to replace the energy used throughout the process of building/transporting/setting it S&W. And let’s remind ourselves how harmful the mining, operating, and afterlife stages of these projects are to planet earth. Hydrogen will come in to push S&W out of the way ONCE all the government officials who have lined their pockets with renewable energy funding tap out. And the White House just threw another $11BB at renewable energy projects…..loudly smack forehead in disbelief now.

**ITEMS OF INTEREST **– The current administration recently approved a multibillion-dollar transmission line that will send **primarily** wind generated power from New Mexico to the West coast. I can’t find the exact price tag other than “multibillion-dollar”, nor can I find a completion date, nor a daily volume to be generated. I’m sure they know what they’re doing. We should all bury our heads back into the sand.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – NYMEX fell again after prices jumped as much as 20% at one-point last week. We’re getting closer to summer heat which increases the CDDs (cooling demand days). If we’re looking at the NYMEX pricing with an over/under, I’m taking the over for the summer, have a dip after the summer heat, then expect the run up into the winter months.

#### **STORAGE REPORT**

The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 110Bcf. The actual number comes in at 99Bcf. We're now 521Bcf higher than this time last year and 340Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,900Bcf. At 2,240Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. Last year this time saw an injection of 76Bcf while the 5-year average for this time of year is 87Bcf. Midwest and Northeast elevated heating demand is to blame for the below average injection number. Storage levels at the end of injection season (Oct ’23) are forecasted to be at 3.89Tcf.

**WEATHER – **EIA’s short term weather outlook had this to say, “Beginning with the May 2023 *Short-Term Energy Outlook* (STEO), our STEO model will combine a 30-year trendline and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s forecast to create our weather forecasts. This methodology change will result in warmer forecast weather in the United States in both the winter and in the summer. The change will involve a one-time shift that will *decrease our heating degree day (HDD) forecast in 2023 by 1% and in 2024 by 4% and increase our cooling degree day (CDD) forecast by 8% in 2023 and by 12% in 2024”*. Weather is a growing factor with current pricing. We have had minimal CDDs. What happens to prices when CDDs hit seasonal average and go above the seasonal average.
