For 4-5-23

Yesterday’s NYMEX trading was the tightest day of trading in over 6 months. Today’s NYMEX, so far, is up a few cents on the front months then seeing red as early as Dec ’23 through Dec ’24. If traders are looking for a direction perhaps tomorrow’s Storage Report will give them the direction that they so desperately need to make decisions – sheep love being told which direction to go. Tomorrow’s Storage Report is forecasted to show the final withdrawal for the season with a mid-20s pull.

Your good news for today – All your questions will be answered one day earlier this week as THE Natural Gas Update will be released tomorrow since our offices will be closed Friday.
