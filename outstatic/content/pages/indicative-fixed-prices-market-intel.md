NYMEX prices rallied as much as $0.20 yesterday based off of cooler weather forecasts. Today started flat before dropping a few cents to end the trading day. Prices are getting bearish support from warmer forecasts, below normal demand for this time of year, and strong daily production.

CA Basis is still expensive but is starting to come off some. The below fixed prices are considerably lower from just one week ago.
