NYMEX rallied to a 2-week high yesterday but is falling hard so far today. Could this bearish movement continue tomorrow with a strong storage injection? Who knows? What we do know is that prices for NYMEX are cheap right now. Cheaper than they have been in years.

We have some bullish factors such as increased LNG exports (up 5.8% to 14.7Bcf/D), above normal temperatures expected across most of the US next week, and a drop in daily dry natgas production (98.9Bcf yesterday compared with the record high of 103.6Bcf on 10-3-22).

We are still 2.2% above this time last year and demand is down right now by 6%. Don’t expect these bearish factors to stay forever.
