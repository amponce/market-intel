NYMEX prices fell further today with increased production (101Bcf) forecasted for the next week. Milder weather also helps to keep things bearish on the NYMEX side. CA Basis continues to fall. Get ready to do some damage over the next few weeks.

Just to point this out – PG&E CG and SoCal CG prompt month, delivered, is below $5.00 - first time in quite some time. You can buy 12 months of delivered PG&E CG + NYMEX (June ’23 start month) for under $6.00, or damn close to it depending on your load profile, right now. When was the last time we saw a 12-month PG&E CG strip under/at $6.00? It’s been a while, hasn’t it??
