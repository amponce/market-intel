NYMEX prices continue to be bearish. Daily production is expected to average above 100Bcf/D for the remainder of 2023 and some are confused as to why production will remain high while prices tank. One of the main reasons we’re seeing production remain strong, when it should be pulling back to lift prices up, is because approximately 1/3 of our domestic production comes up through oil wells and oil production isn’t tapering off ANYTIME soon. So far today, NYMEX and West region basis prices are flat to yesterday’s close.
