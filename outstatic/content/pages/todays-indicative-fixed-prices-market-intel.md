Today’s Storage Report comes in with a 75Bcf injection, smashing the 47Bcf forecast. We’re now 488Bcf above last year at this time and 329 above the 5-year average for this week. NYMEX prices are reacting with downward pressure, as much as $0.08 on the prompt month and red all the way through Dec ’25.

PG&E CG Basis continues to fall on the daily spot pricing and forward month pricing. SoCal CG Basis jumps up on the daily spot price while shedding one penny at a time on forward months.

Way more market intel detail in tomorrow’s Natural Gas Update.
