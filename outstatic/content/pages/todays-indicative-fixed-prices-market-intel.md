5-10-23

NYMEX prices are falling today after a 3-day rally. NYMEX prices are in the $2 range for most of 2023. Compare that to just 10 months ago when prompt months and short-term strips were all over the $10 mark – for NYMEX only. CA Basis delivery pints continue to weaken.

How long will this bearish market last? Basis could and should fall further once capacity and in-state storage increases. NYMEX could take off once demand returns to normal.
