NYMEX has been bouncing around today, as low as $2.26 and as high as $2.37. The higher end prices showed up after the storage injection report came in with an injection of 79Bcf, 4Bcf above the forecast. It seems like this has become standard on Thursday mornings of late; above forecast = a bump up in price and vice versa for below estimates.

Basis for both PG&E CG and SoCal CG continue to fall, as shown in today’s indicative prices below.
