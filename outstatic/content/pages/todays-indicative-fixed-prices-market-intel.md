The 3-day bull run is over! So far this morning, NYMEX is down as much as $0.14 on the prompt month and seeing red all the way through July ’24. As for CA Basis, PG&E CG, PG&E Malin, SoCal CG, SoCal Bdr are all down so far today. Tomorrow’s storage report forecasts an injection of around 65Bcf. Compare this to 47Bcf injected last year and the 5-year average for this week of 41Bcf injected. With the weather forecasts warming up to temps with falling HDDs or CDDs, NYMEX could be a favorable hedge tomorrow…

April production is averaging just around 100Bcf/D.
