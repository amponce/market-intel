A drop in the daily production average - hovering just under 100Bcf/D, wildfires in Canada limiting our daily import from the north, and elevated temps forecasted for the next 2 weeks are pushing both the physical (basis) and the financial (NYMEX) up today. A big drop in active natgas rigs also gives support to the bulls.
