5-9-23

NYMEX nat gas shows little to no change from yesterday. Yesterday closed 4.73% ($0.10) up for the prompt month. The main reason for the upward movement – 102 wildfires burning across Alberta, Canada, shutting down numerous oil and gas wells throughout western Canada. A great example of how market management is so far beyond our domestic control.

CA Basis continues to weaken but is not falling in chunks the way that it has been for the past few weeks. Weather forecasts could be limiting downside movement as heat is expected to roll in by the end of next week.
