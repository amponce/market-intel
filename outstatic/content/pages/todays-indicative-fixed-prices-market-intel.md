We saw a slight summer heat concern push prices up last Friday. That uptick continues today and could continue to run. We’re currently passed the resistance point of $2.24 and will see a strong bull run IF we edge closer to the next resistance level of $2.54. Downward support sits below the $2.24 mark and will pick up downward steam if we hit the $2.18 mark. Currently sitting around $2.34.

All indictive prices today are up from last week, more for PG&E CG than SoCal CG.

Let’s start locking in.
