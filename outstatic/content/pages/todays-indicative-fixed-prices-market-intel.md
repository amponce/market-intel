We are now separating the NYMEX from the PG&E CG Basis and SoCal CG Basis prices so you can track Basis more easily. If you want to track them separately, please go to our website, [RFPEnergySlutions.com](http://RFPEnergySlutions.com), click on Market Intel, then click on the Posts, and there you will find it. It can’t be any simpler.

So, for today - EIA is reporting the first injection of the season with an injection of 25Bcf. We are now 33% over last year and 19% over the 5-year avg. The Pacific region, however, injected 1 measly little Bcf. We remain 56% below last year at ths time and 57% below the 5-year avg.

Not enough to even budge Basis prices. Thankfully, the weather is now helping to push Basis prices down.
