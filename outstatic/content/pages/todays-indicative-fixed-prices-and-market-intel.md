NYMEX is up so far today.

However, lower than normal gas usage in March, higher than normal production, and storage sitting closer to the top end of the 5-year range are all applying downward pressure, keeping the prompt month right around $2.60. Pretty cheap, IMO.

Spring shoulder season may have begun and could last through mid-April (or longer) if no surprises come our way.
