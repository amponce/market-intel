EIA reports an 84Bcf withdrawal after some wide-ranging spread forecasting on the current withdrawal. We are now 493Bcf above last year at this time and 359Bcf above the 5-year average. At 2,030Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range.

Line 3000 is set to come back next Tuesday. SoCalGas immediately cut 600.000MMBtu/D. Hoping all this early maintenance (that is keeping prices up at all related delivery points) will provide a late spring and summer free of any “scheduled” maintenance.

Most strips in the West are up after the report.
