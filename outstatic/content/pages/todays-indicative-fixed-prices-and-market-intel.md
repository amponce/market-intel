For 3-30-23

May is now the front month and continues to be weak. The West Region basis prices remain extremely bullish while we wait for the rain/snow/below normal temps to go away. We’re also waiting for SoCal Gas Co to finish up maintenance on numerous intra pipes. Hurry up, SoCalGas. NYMX is a bear and CA Basis is a ticked off bull. This won’t last forever so wait for Basis corrections and jump on the NYMEX with us.

Today’s storage report comes in with a withdrawal of 47Bcf. We’re now 442Bcf above last year at this time and 341Bcf above the 5-year average. And believe it or not, California had an injection of storage. We remain over 50% below where we need to be but maybe that’s the first of many injections as we roll towards Injection Season.

The feel good story of the day – It’s Opening Day in baseball. Play Ball!!
