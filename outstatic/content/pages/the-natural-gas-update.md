***THE NATURAL GAS UPDATE for 3-24-23***

*SoCal Gas Co pipeline maintenance still has approximately 1.5Bcf/D offline*

THE driving FACTORS

\*\*NYMEX \*\*– The financial piece of natural gas remains bearish as supply outweighs demand. NYMEX is ticking up today so far, however. Bears have been outweighing the bull for the past 6 weeks but let’s not be foolish enough to think this will last through any type of warmer than normal summer.

**BASIS** – Basis remains well above historical averages and should remain in this range while we wait for 1. this winter weather to move out and 2. substantial capacity to come back online.

**RIG COUNT** – Last week marked the largest number of rigs to be added in one week in over 4 years, leading to a rise in the combined oil and gas rig count in 5 weeks. 8 rigs were added in total, 9 for gas rigs (162), with oil dropping by 1 rig (589), for a grand total of 754, up 13.7% from 1 year ago.

**PRODUCTION** – U.S. gas production dropped to 100.1Bcf/D last week while the current week is expected to drop by 0.1Bcf for a flat 100Bcf/D. We’re still well above production levels from previous years but we’ll need to continue setting daily records to keep up with increasing demand.

**DEMAND** – US demand increased by 0.8Bcf last week in the residential and industrial sectors with an expected drop of 1.9Bcf this week.

**CRUDE** – Crude prices hit a 15 month low earlier this week due to a weakening US dollar as well as fear from traders weighing out the current global banking crisis and what effects that may have on the oil and gas sector. After a brief rally midweek that saw WTI move above the $70 mark, it appears WTI will close out this week back around $68.

**NUCLEAR** – Rolls-Royce has received funding from the UK Space Agency to develop a nuclear reactor, on the moon, that could serve as a long-term energy source for lunar bases. The UK Space Agency has given Rolls-Royce 2.9 million British Sterling to construct the reactor, following a 249,000 British Sterling study last year that it also funded. This doesn’t have anything to do with US domestic nuclear, but I feel compelled to mention this story as it baffles me. Do we really need a nuclear reactor on the moon??? The English do some things very well – building cars is not one of them, IMHO, so Rolls Royce putting together a nuclear reactor on the moon doesn’t make me feel warm and fuzzy…

**RENEWABLES** – EDF Renewables and SoCal Public Power Authority sealed a 20 year deal this week that will generate 375,800MWh of clean energy, annually, to 58,000 homes in Anaheim, Pasadena, and Vernon, starting 2026. The project will be built on privately owned land in Riverside County. With over 15,000,000 homes in California, this will cover 0.3% of the homes in California. The reduction of carbon emissions is equivalent to 57,000 passenger vehicles being removed from the road over the course of one year. Baby steps indeed….

\*\*ITEMS OF INTEREST \*\*– I find this very interesting. While California wages war on natural gas, we see just how reliant our Golden State has been on the energy source, leading all US regions in every category except for space heating (Midwest beats the West, 70% to 60%). This is from 2020 but do we really believe these percentages have shifted much in 2 and 1/4 years? My quick answer to that is…nope!

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – NYMEX is at a 25–year low. An extremely mild winter, a cutback in LNG exporting, record setting daily production, and a drop in demand are the main driving factors for these very cheap prices. These prices won’t stay low forever and we shouldn’t expect any strips to plummet another $0.50. Above normal heat indexes this summer leading to an above normal cooling demand, along with increased LNG exports, and production flattening out are all very bullish factors that we should consider when gauging market direction. Basis here in the West, on the other hand, is the highest, on average. Planned and unplanned maintenance, below normal temperatures staying around far longer than originally anticipated, and lack of storage and production are all to blame. We should see a 1.5Bcf/D of capacity return over the next few months, just in time to meet the summer cooling demand. Storage injections should also start in a few weeks, and a mild spring forecast should help push CA basis down. Let’s buy NYMEX and Basis separately for now. Buy the cheap NYMEX now, as far out as we see fit before it runs back up. Then we wait for Basis to fall and pick up Basis cheaper than the ridiculous prices being offered in the current market.

#### **STORAGE REPORT**

The forecast for the latest storage withdrawal, that I saw, was 76Bcf. The actual number comes in at 72Bcf. We're now 504Bcf higher than this time last year and 351Bcf (22%) above the 5-year average of Bcf. At 1,900Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. Here in California, however, we’re about 70% below where we should be for this time of year regarding storage levels. Bullish for CA Basis. Injection season is expected to begin early April.

**WEATHER**

EIA reports that January and February may be close to the warmest on record for those months. This warm period is expected to deliver a drop in heating demand by 11% compared to the same period of 2022. That lack of demand is a major factor in NYMEX being as bearish as it has been. A hotter than normal summer will have the opposite effect on NYMEX prices, as well as Basis prices.
