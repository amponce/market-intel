Hi there, and welcome to Hazel Sprout! I'm Laura, the mom behind this site, and yes, I do have a little sprout named Hazel. As a parent, I know how overwhelming it can be to sift through endless options. After countless hours spent researching the best baby products for my daughter, I thought, 'Why not share this and make life a bit easier for other parents?' And so, Hazel Sprout was born.

Navigating the maze of products on Amazon can feel like a scavenger huntâ€”dodging junk, misleading labels, and SEO trickery just to find something decent. On this site, you'll find only high-quality, reliable products that are exactly as they claim to be. No brands are sponsoring; the buttons on this site that take you to Amazon are affiliate links which means I earn a commission (usually a few cents per item).

By day, I'm a design consultant and work on building user-centered government services. This site is my creative outlet, where I get to combine my eye for design with my research skills to curate the perfect list of baby products and share ideas about what types of things could make your family's life better. Consider Hazel Sprout your go-to platform for handpicked items that both you and your little ones will love.
