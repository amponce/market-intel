• **100% food-grade silicone**: The plates stick firmly to any flat surface, preventing any tipping or tossing, and come with lids to preserve leftovers.

• **Microwave and dishwasher-safe**

• **Four-Point Suction & Divided Design**: The divided sections are ideal for picky eaters, preventing food mixing and making mealtime tantrum-free.
