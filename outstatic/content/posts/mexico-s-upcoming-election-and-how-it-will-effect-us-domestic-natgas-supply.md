Mexico's upcoming 2024 elections are crucial for the future of the country's energy policies and reforms. Both leading candidates represent different approaches to the energy sector:

Claudia Sheinbaum, representing the ruling Morena party, aims to uphold many of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's policies. While she hasn't explicitly detailed her energy strategy, she is expected to maintain strong support for state-run Pemex and CFE, favoring their central role in Mexico's energy landscape. Her background in energy engineering and work on climate issues suggest that she may incorporate renewable energy policies more extensively than her predecessor.

Xóchitl Gálvez, from the opposition coalition, seeks to expand private investment in the energy sector. She envisions a balanced approach, supporting foreign investment in renewables and exploring partnerships to modernize Pemex while restoring confidence in regulatory institutions. Her goal is to leverage private sector expertise to diversify the energy mix and ensure cheaper, cleaner energy for Mexicans.

A pivotal issue for the next administration will be managing Mexico's increasing dependence on imported natural gas, primarily from the United States. This dependence creates vulnerabilities but also offers opportunities for integrating renewable sources and reducing emissions.

Moreover, with the ongoing liberalization debate, the next government will face tough decisions balancing state control with private sector involvement. Addressing Pemex and CFE's financial and operational issues will also be crucial, as these state entities struggle with profitability and efficiency.

In short, the 2024 elections are expected to significantly shape Mexico's energy policies and have lasting implications for the region's economic stability and energy security.
