Bottom Line 📉\
Higher than average storage inventories at the start of winter, warmer than normal winter, reduced HDDs, and continued strong production growth are driving the current price outlook. Many traders expect NYMEX winter strip prices to be between $3.25 - $3.50. Despite bearish factors, weather remains king, and natgas prices should be bullish for the next week or two.\
