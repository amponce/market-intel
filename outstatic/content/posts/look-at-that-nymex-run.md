***WEATHER*** *– NatGasWeather’s latest forecast, “Texas will cool several degrees today as a weather system moves through, but thereafter, the southern 1/3 of the US will be very warm to hot as high-pressure rules w/highs of 80s and 90s, locally 100s Southwest. The northern 2/3 of the US will be comfortable w/highs of 60s-80s as weather systems bring showers.”*

***CA RETAIL POWER*** *– CAISO pricing falls to just over $30 per MWH.* 

***CARBON OFFSETS –*** *We have carbon offset offerings as low as $1 per unit to $375 per unit.  You will find the perfect carbon offset to fit your carbon footprint recovery.* 

***THE BOTTOM LINE*** *– Same as yesterday (production down/LNG exports up/bullish summer weather forecasts PLUS a storage injection that came in well below estimates, last year’s injection, and the 5-year average for this time of year.  Basis remains a good buy.  If we’re waiting for NYMEX to fall below the $2.00 range, we may be waiting for some time.*
