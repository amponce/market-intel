Supply Disruptions and the Benefits of RFP Energy Solutions for Energy Procurement

Supply chain disruptions can have a significant impact on the natural gas market, driving prices higher and making it difficult for businesses to predict their energy costs. In this article, we'll examine the impact of supply disruptions on natural gas prices and explore how RFPES can help streamline the best energy deals for businesses.

Impact of Supply Disruptions on Natural Gas Prices Supply chain disruptions can have a significant impact on natural gas prices, particularly in states like California where the demand for natural gas is high. Recently, the state has experienced several supply chain issues, including pipeline constraints, reduced imports from other states, and maintenance shutdowns at natural gas facilities. These disruptions have limited the amount of natural gas available in the state, driving prices higher.

All contracted suppliers are regularly vetted, ensuring that clients are seeing only top-tier, reliable suppliers.

By using RFPES, businesses can streamline their energy procurement process and take control of the conversation, from start to finish.
