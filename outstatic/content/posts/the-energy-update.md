***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 7-24-23***

*California fighting to become the dumbest state in the U.S. when it comes to energy management and reliability….*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX **– NYMEX is up around $0.15 from 1 week ago but is down a staggering $5.00+ from 1 year ago. The first half of 2023 saw NYMEX fall over 34% from Jan ’23 to June ’23. Mild weather, higher than average inventory, and record production pushed prices down in the first 6 months of 2023. Now here is the question - what’s going to push prices down, or up, for the balance of 2023? Could it be below normal temps for the balance of summer coupled with mild winter forecasts coming true? Could it be continued record production even with prices being below what producers consider break even? Could it be a lack of LNG being exported over the next 12 months? The current support range is $2.48 - $2.54 with resistance at $2.78 - $2.83.

The EIA predicts NYMEX will increase from the current price (roughly $2.70) to a $2.83 average between now and Dec ’23, with an estimated peak of $3.45 in Dec ’23, up from the June ’23 low of $2.18. Dec ’23 is currently priced over the forecasted Dec ’23 price so we could enjoy a downward correction once current market conditions/factors move from bullish to bearish.

**BASIS** – Both PG&E CG Basis and SoCal CG Basis prices jumped anywhere from $0.50 to $1.10 from just 1 week ago. Let me say this again – this shows us just how volatile the West Basis market is and when we see Basis prices fall hard as they did 10 days ago, we need to execute, unless of course, we’re in the business of losing money.

**RIG COUNT** – Last week’s rig count for natgas fell by 2 rigs, for a total of 131 active rigs for natgas. Active oil rigs fell by 7 for a total of 530 rigs currently seeking oil.

**PRODUCTION** – U.S. Natgas production has increased by 68% since 2010. Imagine how energy independent we could be if there weren’t such a war on natgas here in the U.S.? And then imagine how much your overall energy costs could drop with all that excess energy. Then imagine all the benefits we could enjoy by being the #1 energy producer and supplier in the world. Natgas production is up in July, averaging 101.5Bcr/D compared to 101Bcf/D in June.

**DEMAND** – EIA expects demand to increase to 107Bcf/D for Dec ’23, down 2.1Bcf from Dec ’22. Bearish prediction for early winter demand. Currently, the forecast is for demand to rise from 105.7Bcf/D to 107Bcf/D in the coming weeks due to above normal temps in CA and TX.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – Power moving right along with natgas prices. More generation optionality is needed for retail power prices to break from natgas price volatility.

**CARBON OFFSETS – **We’ve got them if you want them – anything from planting more trees in the Western U.S. region to building remote generation in third world countries (this does not include Michigan due to it being a state).

**CRUDE** – Bullish sentiment is building for this commodity. U.S. production for 2023 is on the decline. Saudi sticks with 1MM barrels/D less for Aug ’23. At over $77/B today, we’re approximately $2.50 above this time last week. Don’t feel too bad though because crude is nearly $20.00 cheaper than it was this time last year.

**NUCLEAR** – Smaller modular reactors (SMRs) are gaining more and more interest and for good reasons. Governments around the world are accepting the fact that SMRs are far more reliable, cost effective, and better for the environment than some of those other “green” energies.

**RENEWABLES** – Not playing that broken record today.

**ITEMS OF INTEREST **– You can’t make this up – As California temperatures increase (increasing cooling demand which increases power generation), California state officials have asked EV drivers in the state to “refrain from charging their cars in hopes of avoiding power outages”. This comes just one week after unveiling plans to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035. Not a problem – we’ll just use our safe and reliable public transit system that covers all areas of our major cities to the most lying areas of the state….wait a second…never mind….…….well, we can just rely on our state officials and CPUC to get our poorly managed, poorly maintained, already over-taxed California electric grid up to standards by then….nope…that doesn’t work either…..

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – Traders are keeping a close eye on LNG exports and weather over the next few weeks. A rise in either or both could push short-term prices up. Then we need to look at where prices COULD run this winter if anything out of the ordinary takes place. Look back at the last 4 years where something or another blew prices out, at least once in each of those years between November and March. NYMEX and or Basis doesn’t have to run all the way to $50 - $145 per MMBtu for 1 day to blow out your year’s energy budget. It could be 1 first of the month index that’s priced at $8 or $14 per MMBtu – a slower, softer price run up is just as painful. What do you want to do?

#### **STORAGE REPORT – **The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 45Bcf. The actual number comes in at 41Bcf. We're now 575Bcf higher than this time last year and 360Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,611Bcf. At 2,971Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season levels are expected to be at a record setting 4.1Tcf.

**WEATHER – **The 3-month forecast is above normal for the South, increasing an already high cooling demand. The 6–10-day forecast shows temps above normal for SoCal, well above normal for Texas, South, Southeast, and up to the Mid-Atlantic. Also looking ahead to the Oct – Dec ’23 outlook, above normal conditions for the West and Northeast, with slightly above normal for most of the U.S. except for the Plains and West Great Lakes regions (where “equal chances” are forecasted) paints a bearish forecast.
