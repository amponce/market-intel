***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 8-28-23***

---

*NYMEX, you’re fine. CA Basis, what is your problem??! *

THE DRIVING FACTORS

\*\*NYMEX \*\*– NYMEX spent last week focused far more on supply than the stifling heat here in CA and TX, as well as most of the U.S. NYMEX opened this week at $2.69 for the prompt month, went as high as $2.73, and is currently sitting at today’s low of $2.54. Resistance today starts at $2.75 - $2.82. Support starts at $2.56 - $2.50. We hit that Support level today. We’re in a pretty good pretty spot right now and if the driving factors stay as is, we could see the start of Shoulder Season later this week or by Labor Day Weekend once that bright red ball of heat makes its way across the U.S.

**BASIS** – We know what the problem is with CA Basis – lack of pipeline options, lack of intrastate production, lack of intrastate storage, and a growing demand for natgas even as our state government fights to do away with natgas. Both PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis prices are up strong from last week. Well above normal temperatures in the first half of this week throughout California and the Southwest are pushing basis prices up. Hoping for the CPUC’s storage increased request to be voted in this Thursday. If approved, we should see Basis prices fall. If denied, we should expect greater volatility than what we experienced last winter. Even money until Thursday’s decision. And for those saying Newsom should do the right thing and shut it down, along with Diablo Nuclear, is it safe to assume that you’re willing to pay the difference for everyone when power prices skyrocket here in the Gold-Plated State that is California?

**RIG COUNT** – Last week’s natgas rig count dropped another 2 rigs for a total of 115 active rigs for natgas (down 40 rigs from this time 1 year ago). Active oil rigs fell by 8 for a total of 512 (93 fewer than this time last year). Bullish.

**PRODUCTION** – U.S. Natgas production is back in the 100/101Bcf/D range after topping out at 103Bcf 2 weeks ago. Even with a drop in rigs over the past few months, due to prices collapsing to current levels, we shouldn’t expect production to fall any further.

**DEMAND** – Natgas demand for power generation between Jan ’23 – Aug ’23 jumped 10%. The share of natural gas toward electricity generation in 2023 has increased from 36% to 40% across the U.S. Then factor in LNG exporting, expected to increase by a few Bcfs/D over the next few years.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – Retail power prices here in California are back down into the $50-$60 per MWH range after running up over $250 for a short spell last week.

**CARBON OFFSETS and RSG (responsibly sourced gas) –For all you companies doing business in the EU, signing the corporate letters, committing to a 20% carbon reduction by 2025 at the Paris Agreement, you better get on it. We can help. We expect to be posting the carbon menus on our website by the end of 2023. Until then, call us.**

**CRUDE** – **WTI Crude prices opened this week just over $80 a barrel before falling below the $80 mark later this morning. Crude is down over $1.50 from 1 week ago and down over $12 from 1 year ago. The “experts” are calling for bearish support with prices falling as far as $75 a barrel.**

**NUCLEAR** – Inside Wall Street had this to say about nuclear power last week, “Nuclear power’s reliability and long-lasting plant life make it an attractive option for energy security. At 92%, nuclear power has the highest capacity factor compared to other energy sources. That means nuclear power plants are operating at maximum capacity 92% of the time. Plus, the operational life of a nuclear plant is double that of a gas or coal-fired one. It also allows countries to diversify their energy supply away from fossil fuels while producing energy domestically. And nuclear is an attractive option for the clean energy transition. For example, even though only two additional nuclear reactors have started delivering power to the U.S. grid in the past seven years, nuclear still makes up nearly half of the nation’s carbon-free electricity.” That makes nuclear the nation’s largest source of clean energy in 2022 according to the Department of Energy.

**RENEWABLES** – Solar provides up to 17% of power gen in CA when the sun shines. Hydro provides up to 10% when we’re not at drought levels in CA – take that 10% down to 6% then. Wind offers up 10% in CA when the wind blows, but not if it blows too strongly. Nuclear provides 10% as well and could provide far more than 10% if we hadn’t closed San Onofre in SoCal all those years ago now. So, renewables, please provide the plan you’ve come up with to power California with 100% renewable energy by 2045 as you have proposed. I mean, you must have a super-duper plan in place to have such definitive deadlines, right? Right??

And is that plan at all cost-effective to the average rate payer? Answer the question, please!

\*\*ITEMS OF INTEREST \*\*– California and the Power Generation Contributors – natural gas leads all contributions with 36%. Up next is solar with 17%. Wind, Hydro, and Nuclear all contribute approximately 10% each. The balance is made up of Biomass (2%), Coal (2%), Geothermal (4%), and my favorite, Unspecified (7%). The demand for natural gas in the power mix has been reduced by nearly 20% over the past 10 years. But over the past 6 years, the demand for natgas in California stabilized between 33% - 38% demand for power generation.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – As power demand in the state continues to rise, so will the demand for natural gas. Don’t be fooled by an unchanging percent, it’s the overall increase/demand that matters. And as more companies in California opt for onsite generation (powered by natgas), the C&I sector demand for natgas will also increase. Increase in demand with no increase in supply to match = higher cost of natural gas delivered into the great state of California. And then let’s add in the new international factors we must deal with; LNG exporting, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the stupidity that Europe likes to call progressive energy management. U.S. natgas is very much taking on international driving factors once again. And the more factors we have, especially foreign factors that are driven by issues well out of our domestic little hands, bank on increased volatility and higher delivered natgas prices here in the U.S.

**Indicative Fixed Prices as of 8/28/2023**

\*\*STORAGE REPORT – \*\*The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 29Bcf. The actual number comes in at 18Bcf. We're now 513Bcf higher than this time last year and 268Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,815Bcf. At 3,083Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season level forecast remains at 3.90Tcf, down from the earlier forecast of 4.1Tcf. CPUC is trying to increase Aliso Canyon storage for this winter from 41Bcf to 68Bcf. The vote will be announced 8-31-23.

\*\*WEATHER – \*\*Aug ’23 has been one of the hottest Augusts on record. Even with a record setting month, and looking to finish out the month as such, NYMEX has failed to rally. Or has the weather been that strong that it’s prevented a massive downward bear run??? The 3-month forecast (Sep/Oct/Nov) looks to be even money. The Nov/Dec/Jan forecast looks to favor bears. The 6-day to 10-day forecast is very bullish.
