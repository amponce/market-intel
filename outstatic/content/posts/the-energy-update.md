***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 6-5-23***

*The Hedging Season is now*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

\*\*NYMEX \*\*– NYMEX prices are up $0.10 from 1 week ago and down approximately $6.30 from 1 year ago. Have we seen the bottom of the bear market? Check out the driving factors and let’s come to a decision, shall we?

**BASIS** – PG&E CG Basis continues to fall but not at the rate it was falling a few weeks ago. We may be at the bottom of the bear run, or close to it, for PG&E CG Basis. SoCal CG Basis, on the other hand, is falling in chunks and that’s mainly due to SoCalGas pipeline maintenance taking a break, increasing capacity.

**RIG COUNT** – The latest natural gas rig count shows no change from the previous week. We’re sitting nicely at 137 active natural gas rigs. We continue to be down 14 rigs from 1 year ago and down 91% from the all-time high of 1,606 active rigs in 2008. The rig count is important but not as important as how much natural gas is coming up out of each active rig. We’re producing more natural gas now with fewer active rigs than ever before.

**PRODUCTION** – Barchart reports that “Lower-48 state dry gas production on Friday was 99.7Bcf (+2.3% y/y), just below the record high of 101.7Bcf posted on Apr 23.” We really need to see production average over 105Bcf/D for Basis and NYMEX to settle into price stability. Until then, let’s pick off the cheap months while we can.

**DEMAND** – Lower-48 state gas demand Friday was 66Bcf/day, down -0.4% y/y. We shouldn’t expect this below normal trend to continue through the summer. It’s my belief that once summer temperatures show up, demand will obviously increase, as will both NYMEX and Basis prices.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – We’re leaving the below notice on **THE Energy Update** because it makes a lot of sense to buy third party retail power (Direct Access) here in California, if you have the option. Why? The bulk of Power generation here in the Golden State continues to come from natural ga. So…..if natural gas index prices increase here in California, power prices here in California will also increase. If you could lock in a fixed MWh price and take the risk of index prices off the table, wouldn’t you do that??

*IN CASE YOU MISSED THIS - There is another Direct Access lottery taking place next month. Anyone interested in procuring third party supply (locking in a fixed price and getting out of the volatile index market) should contact their utility account rep to enter the lottery. We’ve been receiving more and more retail power RFPs (Requests for Proposal – just in case you weren’t sure what the RFP in RFP Energy Solutions stands for) in the last few months. Shopping around and performing a proper Retail Power (Direct Access) contract is far more labor-intensive than shopping around for a natural gas contract compared to natural gas (a true commodity). For one, prospective suppliers bidding on your business need to submit paperwork to the utility company to view your usage – the utility company can take over a month to release this information. Pricing is far less transparent than natural gas and offers vary greatly in what is covered I the price. If you’re interested in shopping your retail power contract, or simply have questions, a group like RFP ES, who has experience in breaking down contract offers, can be a great benefit to you. Call us. *

\*\*CARBON OFFSETS – \*\*Carbon Offset offerings continue to grow in terms of project, cost, and location. We have too many to post on here so contact us directly. We can set you up with a weekly menu of carbon offsets to view. One reason why it’s a good thing to begin viewing carbon offsets now rather than later is since both federal and state level government is pressing the C & I sector to increase their ESG levels and buy renewable energy in some manner or another. You can start now by choosing carbon footprint reducing projects that fit your budget and your type of project, or you can wait and be told by the government which project to buy, and for how much.

Credits are being given now by the government. Government credits don’t last forever. Contact us directly and we will gladly provide you with our supplier partners’ carbon offset menus. To learn more about carbon offsets, just give us a call.

**CRUDE** – Our prediction of Saudi and OPEC cutting back on daily production just to teach us pesky traders here in the Western world that they control the price of crude, and not us, is playing out now as another 1MM barrel/D are being cut through July ’23, with threats of the cutback lasting into and through 2024. July ’23 Crude is currently sitting above $72/barrel, having run as high as $75+ today. This should encourage domestic production to increase.

**NUCLEAR** – Several leading energy specialists around the world believe the only way we will reach our emissions goals, from a reliability standpoint/cost efficiency standpoint/realistic standpoint, is for a greater focus on nuclear power. Without nuclear, these same specialists believe there is no way the world can get to zero emissions and away from fossil fuels entirely, not that we’re getting there anytime soon, if ever, in my humble opinion. But we can do a better job getting there all around and one way is rethinking nuclear and how we manage it moving forward. Massive nuclear reactors can be offset with small modular reactors (SMRs as the cool kids are calling them). To read more about SMRs and how they will outpace solar and wind by a country mile, check out the article from [SmallCaps.com](http://SmallCaps.com) that we posted earlier today on both Twitter and LinkedIn pages.

**RENEWABLES** – Solar & Wind combined for a total net generation of 66,000MWh in March ’23. Compare that to 49,000MWh in coal, 132,000MWh in natgas, and 62,000MWh in nuclear, in the same month, proving once again that S&W will never get the world where it needs to be regarding smart energy choices. And we haven’t scraped the surface of just how bad these two energy sources are for Mother Earth. If you think S&W are the answer, in any way, <s>you’re completely clueless and shouldn’t be put in charge of decisions outside of vending machine items in your company’s breakroom</s>

you may be wrong.

\*\*ITEMS OF INTEREST \*\*– SoCalGas is pretty much done with pipeline maintenance with no further maintenance planned until mid-July. If you don’t like the price of Basis now, while weather is mild, demand is down, and maintenance is minimal, chances are that you really won’t like it when temps heat up, demand jumps up, and capacity decreases.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – NYMEX is creeping up. California Basis prices continue to fall while weather and demand stay below average. Production is down ever so slightly, most likely due to cheap prices being a non-motivator to produce more. LNG Exports are growing.

#### **STORAGE REPORT**

The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 107Bcf. The actual number comes in at 110Bcf. We're now 557Bcf higher than this time last year and 349Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,097Bcf. At 2,446Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range.

\*\*WEATHER – \*\*Below normal temperatures for most of the US over the next few weeks should keep demand slightly below normal, limiting the seasonal bull run that usually takes place in the first week of June.
