***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 7-31-23***

---

*NYMEX is trying to move up but having trouble doing so.*

THE driving FACTORS

\*\*NYMEX \*\*– NYMEX prices for the prompt month (Sep ’23) are down around a nickel from 1 week ago. NYMEX is down roughly $5.50 from 1 year ago. NYMEX is trying to push its way back up but is having trouble doing so right now as weather patterns shift, demand steadies, and production stays at/above the 100Bcf/D mark.

**BASIS** – Both PG&E CG Basis and SoCal CG Basis prices are up from 1 week ago – a dime for PG&E CG, varied for SoCal CG. The good news is that spot SoCal CG Basis continues to fall from last week’s high (due to the Wheeler pipeline shutting in 650,000MMBtu/D for unplanned maintenance) and is now approximately $0.50 above where it was from 1 week ago, before Wheeler took off 650,000MMBtu/D.

**RIG COUNT** – Last week’s rig count for natgas fell by 3 rigs, for a total of 128 active rigs for natgas. Active oil rigs fell by 1 for a total of 529 rigs currently seeking oil.

**PRODUCTION** – U.S. Natgas production continues to stay around the 100/101Bcf range. We shouldn’t expect an increase in daily production until natgas prices see some true gains in the market.

**DEMAND** – U.S. LNG exports set a record in the first half of 2023. If record setting LNG exports from our shores continue through the winter months, and they should continue unless Russia releases a great deal more of their natural gas than currently promised, we could see similar price volatility like last winter. If Russia does release more natgas to the rest of Europe this winter, US LNG exports to Europe could be curbed, bringing on a domestic natgas glut, pushing domestic NYMEX (and some Basis) prices down. Another mild U.S winter would lessen demand, most likely pushing daily spot prices down before pushing short term strips down. It could happen. Feeling lucky or smart?

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – Power supply here in California was right around 5% above the current power demand in California for the last few weeks. More energy options to generate power in California are desperately needed. CAISO is averaging $61 per MWH.

\*\*CARBON OFFSETS – \*\*We’ve got them if you want them – anything from planting more trees in the Western U.S. region to building remote generation in third world countries (this does not include Michigan due to it being a state).

**CRUDE** – Crude WTI ran up over the $81.50 mark earlier today. Hoping you followed our lead from a few weeks ago when we said that this commodity was about to enjoy a good bull run - $10+ per barrel so far. Nice. A weak US dollar and increased demand should keep this bull running. Tightening supplies are also helping to push prices up. We’re down 0.6MM barrels from 1 week ago but up 34MM barrels from 1 year ago. And Saudi threatens further and extended cuts.

**NUCLEAR** – The U.S. provides nearly 50% of the uranium used for our domestic nuclear reactors. Most of the balance of uranium comes from Russia. The current administration wants to ban 1.1MM acres of domestic uranium mining, making the U.S even more dependent on energy sources outside of the U.S, namely Russia. Not a smart move by our public servants, in my humble opinion.

**RENEWABLES** – Last Friday our Department of Energy announced plans to re-purpose some of the land it owns, "portions of which were previously used in the nation's nuclear weapons program" for clean energy purposes. The DOE will lease out the land for "utility-scale clean energy projects" in an initiative called "Cleanup to Clean Energy." Question for the ever-forward-thinking DOE - How long will this project take, how much will it cost, how much energy will be generated, and just how much do you stand to make on these leases? Keep an on this DOE grift.

\*\*ITEMS OF INTEREST \*\*– Humidity in the Golen State – this past weekend humidity surpassed 85% in parts of California. The number of days with humidity over 70% here in California continues to rise every summer with no signs of this trend reversing. Air conditioning units are being used more and are being added to more homes and buildings, whether they be old or new homes and buildings, than ever before. This will require more natural gas to meet the growing power demand to meet the increased usage, most likely driving up the price of power in the state while we find ways to generate more and put an even greater burden on our outdated electric grid. Throw all this in with the ever-increasing push for EVs, no natgas in new homes or buildings in a growing number of towns/cities/counties here in California and we are staring straight into….darkness.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – The world continues to consume more energy by the day. This will continue to increase. Don’t think for a second that it will not. Energy will become more expensive and less reliable while the people put in charge of this growing problem bury their heads in the sand. We’ll need to be more proactive and ready to execute when prices fall if we are to protect ourselves from the growing number of violent price spikes.

***First of the Month Index Pricing Average for 2022***

***!!!!!12 MONTH FIXED PRICES CONTINUE TO BEAT THE 2022 FIRST OF THE MONTH INDEX AVERAGES!!!!!***

**Indicative Fixed Prices as of 7/31/2023**

Start Date Term PG&E CG SoCal CG

Sep ’23 1 mo. $5.64 $7.47

Sep ’23 3 mo. $5.88 $7.22

Sep ‘23 6 mo. $7.10 $8.85

Nov ’23 – Mar ‘24 $7.40 $9.20

Apr ’24 – Aug ‘25 $4.94 $5.71

\*\*STORAGE REPORT – \*\*The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 13Bcf. The actual number comes in at 16Bcf. We're now 573Bcf higher than this time last year and 345Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,642Bcf. At 2,987Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season levels have dropped .1Tcf to 4.0Tcf.

\*\*WEATHER – \*\*The 3-month forecast is above normal for the South, increasing an already high cooling demand. The Oct – Dec ’23 outlook shows above normal conditions for the West and Northeast, with slightly above normal for most of the U.S. except for the Plains and West Great Lakes regions (where “equal chances” are forecasted) paints a bearish forecast. The 6–10-day forecast shows temps above normal for SoCal, well above normal for Texas, South, Southeast, and up to the Mid-Atlantic. The 5-day to 15-day forecast favors lower prices as cooling demand looks to fall below normal for a large part of the U.S.
