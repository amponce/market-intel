***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 9-11-23***

**NEVER FORGET **

THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX **– NYMEX prompt month fell hard after Labor Day Weekend, as low as $2.56. We’re starting this week with an opening price of $$2.60, a high of $2.60, and a low of $2.58. Flat start to this week.

Resistance today starts at $2.69. Support starts at $2.49.

NYMEX is now forecasted to average $3.00 for 2023, $3.42 for 2024, $3.94 for 2025, and just and $3.96 for 2026.

**BASIS** – Both PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis continue to fall. We are now 6 days straight on falling basis. We may not see Basis collapse to historical ranges for quite some time, if ever. We are limited in the West for supply and higher than historical Basis prices now seem to be part of the “norm” here in the western world. As high as they may be right now, we know there is plenty of potential for Basis prices to run up. We need to lock in Basis prices for this winter to minimize risk. Want more support for this, skip The Bottom Line below.

**RIG COUNT** – Last week’s natgas rig count dropped 1 rig for a total of 113 active rigs for natgas. Active oil rigs increased by 1 for a total of 513 (92 fewer than this time last year).

**PRODUCTION** – Current Dry Natgas production = 102.2Bcf/D, down 0.4Bcf from the previous week. Canadian imports = 5.6Bcf/D. Production is up 1.4Bcf/D from 1 year ago and up 6.87Bcf from 3 years ago.

**DEMAND** – Total natgas demand in the U.S = 98.7Bcf/D, down 2.2Bcf/D from the previous week. Demand is up 9Bcf/D from 1 year ago, and up 8Bccf from 3 years ago.

Exports to Mexico = 6.2Bcrf/D. LNG Exports = 12.1Bcf/D. And 7.1Bcf/D went to pipe fuel loss.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – Retail power prices here in California fell below the $60 mark two weeks ago, and then fell under the $45-mark last week. Compare that to $250 just 3 weeks ago.

**CO (carbon offsets) and RSG (responsibly sourced gas) – **companies like Shell, Leon, Gucci, and Nestle are all questioning the current carbon offset market and the validity of some of the CO offerings currently out there. This is a great thing, in my opinion, because the last thing we need are more bogus climate/earth saving schemes.

**CRUDE** – **WTI Crude prices are over $87 at the time of this report. Crude is now expected to average $86 for 2023, $81 for 2024, and $73 for 2025. Saudi will extend their current 1MM barrels/day cut through end of 2023. Russia extends their current 300,000 barrels/day cut through the end of 2023 as well. That should keep prices up through the winter.**

**NUCLEAR** – This energy source contributed 9.2% of the world’s power generation in 2022, down 4% from the previous year. The 4% drop came from France having to perform maintenance on some of their reactors. We can expect that percentage to grow dramatically going forward. In case you were wondering, coal leads with 35.4%, then natgas with 22.7%, hydro with 14.9%, wind with 7.2%, solar with 4.5%, and then “other” with 2.7%.

**RENEWABLES** – Reuters reported this last Friday, “Offshore wind developers stayed away from Britain's latest renewable energy auction on Friday, arguing the price offered by the government did not reflect rising industry costs, something which is hampering wind projects globally.” One big reason for the lack of interest is the price capping per MWh (44 English pounds). Wind turbines are very expensive to manufacture, manage, and dispose of. With the lack of taxpayer funded green energy credits being thrown around, the price of that MWh was sure to fall to a more competitive rate. And to truly work, the solution/ product should always be better than the product it’s replacing, not simply competitive, and most certainly not inferior.

Case in point……Pattern Energy just celebrated the groundbreaking of their project, SunZia. “Just north of Corona (New Mexico) last Friday. The company’s SunZia transmission and wind project, kicking off a three-year construction process to bring the system online by (the end of) 2026. Once built, SunZia will transport up to 3 GW of wind energy — enough power to meet the needs of 3 million people — from Central New Mexico to South Central Arizona for use in western markets via a new 550-mile high-voltage transmission line. The project, which took 15 years to get all government approvals in place, is billed as the largest single clean-energy development effort in U.S. history, and possibly the largest ever in the Western Hemisphere.” The estimated US population by 2026 is over 345MM. This project has the potential (when working at full capacity) to serve up to…..LESS THAN 1% of the US population. What a waste of time and (quite literally) energy.

**ITEMS OF INTEREST **– The state government of California claimed two Fridays ago that California is now 100% drought free. All that tells me is that our state government gets the green light to kick this can further down the road, wasting taxpayer money on more foolish, bloated government programs that help no one but special interest groups, while the taxpayers are told to embrace scorched lawns, build rock gardens for children to play in (or not), all while increasing the growth of the true California state flower – kindling. California has always been a drought state and leaving it up to nature to change that just won’t happen. We need real solutions to overcome this problem. Labor Day is over. Get back to work, CA state government.

THE BOTTOM LINE – Winter is coming and with it, the possibility of natgas demand surpassing supply. Dec ’21 demand averaged 10Bcf/D more than supply. In Dec ’22 demand averaged 20Bcf more than supply. If you’re on Monthly/Daily Index/Spot pricing when demand surpasses supply, be prepared for higher prices. Just in case you forgot…Dec ’21/Jan’22 NGI Index for PG&E CG = $6.35/$7.72. SoCal CG = $7.37/$9.84, NYMEX alone = $5.16/$4.04. Dec ’22 NGI Index for PG&E CG = $14.08/$49.52, SoCal CG = $15.11/$54.30, and NYMEX alone = $6.83/$5.21. Do we have your attention now? I thought we might. Get it on the expected downward trend over the next few weeks and enjoy the upcoming holiday season.

**STORAGE REPORT – **The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 41Bcf. The actual number comes in at 33Bcf. We're now 462Bcf higher than this time last year and 222Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,926Bcf. At 3,148Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season level forecast remains at 3.90Tcf.

**WEATHER – **The 6 – 10 day forecast shows solid cooling from central TX, up the Plains, into the Great Lakes, across to New England, and all the way down through the Mid-Atlantic to the Southeast. This period, 9-17-23 through 9-25-23, may be our time to hedge winter months. And if this winter fails to show up, we could downward pressure on prices for the early months of 2024.
