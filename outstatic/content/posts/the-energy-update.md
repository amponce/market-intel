***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 8-21-23***

*Summer Heat Moving East Allows for Basis Bears in The West*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX **– NYMEX is up so far today, bouncing between $2.55 - $2.66. NYMEX is down roughly $0.15 from 1 week ago and down roughly $6.50 from 1 year ago. Resistance is set at $2.65 - $2.75. Support is set at $2.55 - $2.50. We’re currently at $2.63 for the prompt month.

**BASIS** – Basis prices at all CA delivery points, as well as other SW region basis delivery points, are falling hard from last week. These same delivery point basis prices could fall further this week and in the coming week(s) as the heatwaves fall apart, and if the increase to Aliso Canyon storage takes place.

**RIG COUNT** – Last week’s rig count dropped another 6 rigs for a total of 117 active rigs for natgas. Active oil rigs held steady from the previous week for a total of 525 rigs currently seeking oil – down 14% from 1 year ago this time.

**PRODUCTION** – U.S. Natgas production hit 103Bcf/D last week. We shouldn’t expect this level of production to continue due to NYMEX prices being so low right now, eliminating any profit at the production level. What may help keep production levels up is natgas being produced alongside oil as oil prices remain elevated.

**DEMAND** – U.S. domestic natural gas demand is down from last week. This trend could continue throughout this week as temperatures fall further in many parts of the U.S. Mexico’s demand could be down this week as the country recovers from Hilary. We still must keep an eye on the growing demand factor that is LNG.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – CAISO reported that power demand hit 44GW on 8-16-23, the highest to date. Retail power prices here in California ran above $230 per MWH last week. CAISO is reporting power prices at only $52 per MWH so far today.

**CARBON OFFSETS and RSG (responsibly sourced gas) –For all you companies doing business in the EU, signing the corporate letters, committing to a 20% carbon reduction by 2025 at the Paris Agreement, you better get on it. We can help. We expect to be posting the carbon menus on our website by the end of 2023. Until then, call us.**

**CRUDE** – **WTI Crude prices are starting off this week just over $80 a barrel at the time of this update. Crude is down over $2.00 from 1 week ago and down over $10 from 1 year ago. **

**NUCLEAR** – As coal plants are retired, some plants will be upgraded to zero-emission nuclear reactor plants. Duke Energy has proposed just that at the Belews Creek Steam Station located northeast of Winston-Salem, NC. And our neighbors to the north are taking off their energy blinders and have earmarked $74MM for SMRs to be built in Saskatchewan. Come on, U.S., what are we waiting for? How many billions must be wasted on S&W before accepting the fact there are far better options available to us??

**RENEWABLES** – Some deniers may want to skip this section entirely…..pause for dramatic music …..Most used windmill blades end up being buried in the ground with an estimated 47MM tons of “blade waste” by 2050. 90% of solar panels end up in landfills. Source – Cambridge University. And for the small percentage of panels and blades that are recycled, take a guess what energy source is used in the recycling process. Why drill for oil & gas when you can mine for nickel, lithium, and cobalt instead??? Anyone who still believes these two energy sources are practical, affordable, reliable, and good for the environment, is an…..better not finish that sentence….how about….isn’t paying attention? Let’s go with that.

**ITEMS OF INTEREST **– Hurricane/TS Hilary and a 5.1 Earthquake in one Sunday afternoon. Heading out to help some neighbors with newfound leaks in their homes. We can get back to energy tomorrow.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – Patience is the key! We have better weather on the way, a drop in cooling demand expected, and storage stability possibly increasing. All good things to have to push prices down here in the West.

**STORAGE REPORT – **The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 35Bcf. The actual number comes in at 35Bcf. We're now 549Bcf higher than this time last year and 299Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,766Bcf. At 3,065Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season level forecast falls AGAIN to 3.90Tcf, down from the earlier forecast of 4.1Tcf. CPUC is trying to increase Aliso Canyon storage for this winter from 41Bcf to 68Bcf. The vote will be announced 8-31-23.

**WEATHER – Time to change the weather charts from summer to winter!! **The 3-month forecast (Sep/Oct/Nov) shows some Indian Summer possibility. In the past, warmer temps in the South and Gulf regions, later in the season, have been coupled with a higher hurricane count. When hurricanes come to shore, they often knock out power, dropping natural gas demand and creating a glut of natural gas supply. That glut can push NYMEX and (regional) Basis prices down. Then we look at the Nov/Dec/Jan forecast and it’s looking very mild, especially in the regions that pile on HDDs (heating demand days, people – you should know these acronyms by now). If that forecast comes to fruition, a second possible natural gas glut could take place.

The 5-day to 10-day forecast looks bearish with above normal temperatures sitting in areas already expected to be hot. The 10-day to 15-day forecast also favors bearish prices as most of the U.S. is forecasted to enjoy normal to below normal temperatures.
