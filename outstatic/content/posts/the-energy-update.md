***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 5-30-23***

---

*California Basis Continues to Fall*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

\*\*NYMEX \*\*– NYMEX prices continue to fall on milder weather and below normal demand. NYMEX prompt month, which is now July ’23, is down as much as $0.15 today. We’re seeing prices in the red all the way through May ’25. We’re down approximately $0.55 from 1 week ago and down nearly $7.00 from a year ago. But those of you who want to press that bet just a little harder in the hopes of breaking below the $2.10 or even $2.00 mark…..that’s on you.

**BASIS** – PG&E CG Basis continues to fall from record highs set 6 months ago. SoCal CG Basis continues to fall as well and is picking up a little pace on its downward movement. We’re still waiting for pipe maintenance to finish up here in SoCal. Maintenance was scheduled for completion at the end of April, but we all know our California utility companies get a “Fail” when it comes to staying on schedule and putting the end users’ priorities first and foremost. Prove me wrong, PG&E and SoCalGas, by putting in the work that gets Basis prices back to their historical range.

**RIG COUNT** – The latest rig count shows a decline for the fourth straight week, falling by another 4 rigs for a total of 137 active rigs. We’re down 14 rigs from 1 year ago and down 91% from the all-time high of 1,606 active rigs in 2008. Not to worry though because the average cost of NYMEX for 2008 was $9.03.

**PRODUCTION** – Production remains right around 100Bcf/D. We’ll need to increase this number as LNG exports grow. However, we can’t expect increased production when NYMEX prices are where they are.

**DEMAND** – Mild weather and the first long holiday weekend of the summer has demand sitting at below normal levels.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – IN CASE YOU MISSED THIS - There is another Direct Access lottery taking place next month. Anyone interested in procuring third party supply (locking in a fixed price and getting out of the volatile index market) should contact their utility account rep to enter the lottery. We’ve been receiving more and more retail power RFPs (Requests for Proposal – just in case you weren’t sure what the RFP in RFP Energy Solutions stands for) in the last few months. Shopping around and performing a proper Retail Power (Direct Access) contract is far more labor-intensive than shopping around for a natural gas contract compared to natural gas (a true commodity). For one, prospective suppliers bidding on your business need to submit paperwork to the utility company to view your usage – the utility company can take over a month to release this information. Pricing is far less transparent than natural gas and offers vary greatly in what is covered I the price. If you’re interested in shopping your retail power contract, or simply have questions, a group like RFP ES, who has experience in breaking down contract offers, can be a great benefit to you. Call us.

\*\*CARBON OFFSETS – \*\*Carbon Offset offerings continue to grow in terms of project, cost, and location. We have too many to post on here so contact us directly. We can set you up with a weekly menu of carbon offsets to view. One reason why it’s a good thing to begin viewing carbon offsets now rather than later is since both federal and state level government is pressing the C & I sector to increase their ESG levels and buy renewable energy in some manner or another. You can start now by choosing carbon footprint reducing projects that fit your budget and your type of project, or you can wait and be told by the government which project to buy, and for how much.

Credits are being given now by the government. Government credits don’t last forever. Contact us directly and we will gladly provide you with our supplier partners’ carbon offset menus. To learn more about carbon offsets, just give us a call.

**CRUDE** – Crude prices fell below the $70 mark due to a slowdown in global demand. It shouldn’t be long before OPEC cuts back even further on production. They’re already ticked off with traders around the world for “interfering” with their price management of the commodity so what’s another cutback to them?

**NUCLEAR** – US News reported that, “Georgia Power Co. announced Monday that Unit 3 at [Plant Vogtle](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-nuclear-power-plant-vogtle-rates-costs-75c7a413cda3935dd551be9115e88a64), southeast of Augusta, has reached its full output of 1,100 megawatts of electricity. That's enough to power an estimated 500,000 homes and businesses. The power will be sent to Georgia and other states.” A nuclear reactor facility takes up approximately 1 square mile. Compare that to the Solar Star solar farm project in Kern and Los Angeles counties here in California. Solar Star is the largest solar farm in the US. It takes up over 8 square miles, produces 579 megawatts of power, providing enough power for 255,000 homes. And yet SOME people are going to push for solar over nuclear…..why is that? What’s their gain on this lesser energy source, I wonder? Their gain in definitely green…..

**RENEWABLES** – The snowpack here in the West begins its process of turning to hydro. The mild weather we’re experiencing should help deliver higher levels of hydro due to cooler temps giving the snowpack more time to melt. The slower we can convert the snowpack to hydro, the more hydro we will capture – the great state of California has only been set up to capture average snowpack levels. It just doesn’t make sense to capture levels ABOVE NORMAL in a state that is prone to drought and has limited energy source options, does it now? We can’t fix stupid, but we can certainly find a better way to work with and around stupid.

\*\*ITEMS OF INTEREST \*\*– The driving factors for energy pricing are mostly in our favor right now. Everything is going along very nicely and we’re seeing advantageous pricing from it. We’re experiencing the other side of the spectrum right now. Nothing lasts forever. Remember Dec ‘23/Jan ’23? Remember how we said it wasn’t smart to go into winter with open positions?

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – NYMEX prices are cheap. Basis prices are falling. Weather remains in our favor, for now. Demand is down, for now. Production remains strong. Exports are growing. The choices are clear as to what needs to be done.

#### **STORAGE REPORT**

The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 101Bcf. The actual number comes in at 96Bcf. We're now 529Bcf higher than this time last year and 340Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,996Bcf. At 2,336Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range.

\*\*WEATHER – \*\*Below normal temperatures for most of the US should over the next few weeks should keep demand slightly below normal, helping to keep prices bearish. The June – Aug forecast has weakened as has the Sep – Nov forecast.
