***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 7-17-23***

*“The downside is limited. The upside…not so much.” R. Washington 7-11-23*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

\*\*NYMEX \*\*– NYMEX is feeling some bearish pressure despite climbing cooling demand days in the West, SW, and Texas. Currently sitting just over $2.50, a move over $2.75 - $3.10 range will bring bulls. The bears are sitting at the downside range of $2.35 - $2.10.

**BASIS** – Both PG&E CG Basis and SoCal CG Basis prices have all fallen significantly over the past 3 weeks, SoCal CG especially. Currently, both delivery points continue to fall all the way through Oct ’24 before moving up in price compared to last week. Some months see PG&E CG Basis prices getting close to their historical range. Why not buy those cheap months now?

**RIG COUNT** – Last week’s rig count fell by 2 rigs for a total of 133 active natgas rigs. We’ve seen a drop in rig counts 10 of the last 11 weeks.

**PRODUCTION** – The weekend saw us push back over 100Bcf/D from 98.5Bcf/D. If we can remain at or above 100Bcf/D, we have a good chance of keeping bulls at bay.

**DEMAND** – Exports could be easing up in Europe with Norway opening more capacity. U.S. domestic demand for natgas stays steady at the power plants as weather eases demand in the MW and NE as temperatures range in the 70’s and 80’s. Once power generation demand increases, natgas will be one of the sources called upon to meet that increasing demand.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – Power prices are falling in CA as they are tied directly to natgas prices. Good time to extend hedges.

\*\*CARBON OFFSETS – \*\*We have carbon offset menus that can help lower current and future carbon footprints. Projects and price per unit vary greatly, making it easy to find a carbon offset to fit your budget and goals.

**CRUDE** – Saudi’s extended cut of 1MM barrels/day through Aug ’23 has limited any potential downside pricing. Russia backed up Saudi’s cut with a 0.5MM barrels/day through Aug ’23 as well. By last Friday’s closing bell, we saw crude run just over $77/barrel. This week opened at $74.88, running up to $76 before closing the day’s trading at $74.01.

It’s a shame that the U.S. can’t be the largest producer of oil in the world, increasing domestic reliability while exporting oil to other countries, releasing them of from a certain stranglehold. Hold on a second…we are the largest producer of oil in the world! California alone has more oil in the ground than all of Saudi. All we must do is pull our heads out of the sand and do what needs to be done. In the meantime, play the up & down movement on crude prices all summer long.

**NUCLEAR** – Tennessee is pushing to become the top state for nuclear companies to invest in and build in. We can expect more states (at least the states looking to maximize their tax dollars collected) to follow. Building the smaller reactors should be safer, easier to manage, more affordable, taking up less space and not nearly as daunting an image as the massive reactors built in the past. France seems to be leading the way with nuclear, building more and more reactors to cover their domestic demand as well as setting themselves up to be the premier seller of nuclear to other European countries that fail to see the big picture beyond the unicorn dream.

**RENEWABLES** – This came from [Earth.org](http://Earth.org) over the weekend, “According to [World Energy Outlook 2022](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2022/the-global-energy-crisis), a flagship publication on analysis and projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA), we are in the middle of the first global energy crisis. 90% of the increased global pressure on electricity prices is due to high gas, oil, and coal prices. The global energy shock makes us realize that this weak energy system, which relies heavily on non-renewable resources, is unsustainable. According to the IEA, this energy crisis has stimulated the installation and usage of solar photovoltaic cells and wind energy in 2022, which will continue to grow in the coming few years. These renewables are crucial to cutting down on pollution, generating clean energy, and addressing energy security issues. Moreover, the energy created will be cheaper and more affordable. Tapping the huge potential of solar, wind, and hydropower can accelerate the energy economy.”

WRONG. The increased global pressure on electricity prices due to high gas, oil, and coal prices is directly due to renewable being unable to make any consistent contribution to power demand. Demand for oil, gas, and coal for power generation have all increased during our plight for a renewable energy planet (the Unicorn Plan). Simple wishing and hoping just won’t get us where we need to get.

\*\*ITEMS OF INTEREST \*\*– We posted an article over the weekend from Maria Bonaventura, Senior Managing Editor, Inside Wall Street with Nomi Prins. This makes for a god item of interest. “No matter how you feel about renewable energy, one thing remains true. There just isn’t enough of it to meet our rising energy demands.<br>

Right now, the United States is facing its most severe energy crisis in almost five decades. Prices are skyrocketing, and the availability of energy is becoming increasingly limited. The good news is the U.S. is rich in energy resources like oil and natural gas. Texas is a major power producer – not just for the United States but for the rest of the world, too. And it’s on track to be a major player in securing energy independence for the U.S. and its allies. It’s all part of a plan that will cement the U.S. as the king of energy for decades.”

This all goes back to the opening headline from one of our esteemed RFP ES partners, Ricco Washington. When asked last week on a call how he sees the short/middle/long term energy markets, natgas especially, his response was dead on point - Do we see natgas falling below $2.00 per MMBtu or is there a better chance of it going over $3.00 and $4.00? The forward NYMEX prices show prices well into the $3 and 4 range but no months falling below the $2.00 mark or coming close to it at the time of this update.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – Europe is starting to fill up storage with the help of Norway’s scheduled maintenance being completed this week, opening more capacity to be used now as well as to be stored for winter in various countries. That could lessen the LNG demand coming from the U.S., possibly allowing more domestic supply to find its way to the C&I sector. That’s what analysts and traders are looking at right now – this coming winter, 6 months, and 12 months out. And let’s face it – we are already halfway through 2023 and increasing winter concerns will only give support to bull runs for both NYMEX and Basis. Do you want to hold open positions going into winter? DO YOU?

***First of the Month Index Pricing Average for 2022***

***PG&E CG = $8.298 SoCal CG = $8.380***

***!!!!!12 MONTH FIXED PRICES CONTINUE TO BEAT THE 2022 FIRST OF THE MONTH INDEX AVERAGES!!!!!***

**Indicative Fixed Prices as of 7/17/2023**

Start Date Term PG&E CG SoCal CG

Aug ’23 1 mo. $4.88 $5.95

Aug ’23 3 mo. $4.75 $5.55

Aug ‘23 6 mo. $5.71 $7.15

Nov ’23 – Mar ‘24 $6.50 $8.30

Apr ’24 – Aug ‘25 $4.76 $5.50

#### \*\*STORAGE REPORT – \*\*The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 65Bcf. The actual number comes in at 49Bcf. We're now 569Bcf higher than this time last year and 364Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,566Bcf. At 2,930Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season levels are expected to be at a record setting 4.1Tcf.

\*\*WEATHER – \*\*The 3-month forecast shows above normal for most of the U.S. The 6–10-day forecast shows temps well above normal for the West, SW, Texas while the rest of the U.S. enjoys cooler than normal temperatures. Also looking ahead to the winter months, an above normal forecast could be helping to keep NYMEX and Basis from gaining strength. Basis prices for the California prices are high enough for those winter months already. Any downward pressure for those winter strips would be welcomed and acted on.
