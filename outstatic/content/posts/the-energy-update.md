***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 6-26-23***

*And just like that, the long bear walk is over! *

THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX **– NYMEX prices increased over $0.25 per MMBtu last week. It’s up another nickel so far this week. We’re still down over $3.50 per MMBtu compared to 1 year ago but that’s half of what it was just 3 weeks ago when we were down as much as $6.50 from a year ago. We shouldn’t be surprised if this current bull run continues over the next few weeks, or longer. Most all the fundamentals are turning bullish. It may be a slow build up but it’s building, IMHO.

**BASIS** – PG&E CG Basis has flattened out for the time being. Those who wanted to wait another week for PG&E CG Basis to fall further, you’re going to be waiting for a while now. SoCal CG Basis put an end to its downward run with front months way up from a week ago. All the mild weather and increased capacity we enjoyed over the past few weeks is gone for now. Most of us can wait.

**RIG COUNT** – The latest rig count (June 23, 2023) shows a decline in active rigs for the 8th straight week. Same for the oil rig count. Natgas rigs are down 71 rigs compared to 1 year ago. So far in 2023, we’re down 97 rigs.

**PRODUCTION** – Pipeline maintenance across the US has pulled down daily production by over 2Bcf. Couple that with another drop in the rig count, and you will see some nervous bulls showing up when it comes to NYMEX and Basis pricing.

**DEMAND** – Everywhere except for the PJM and SERC regions are expected to experience demand levels well above normal this summer, pushing electric grids across the US to the breaking point.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – KW hours in California were running cheap over the last month. Not so much right now. If natgas is down, power prices will be down, and vice versa. Retail power prices are still some of the cheapest we’ve seen in some time, so the opportunities are still there to beat past years/seasons. If you’re looking to lock in fixed prices and/or hedges, you may have a better opportunity again in a month or two.

**CARBON OFFSETS – **We have numerous carbon offset menus with different projects and different unit pricing. If your company is looking to offset your carbon footprint and gets a jump on buying carbon offsets before you are mandated to do so, just call us and we can provide you with the carbon offsets menus to review.

**CRUDE** – Crude remains below $70 for now. Here’s some fun facts - Fossil fuels accounted for 82% of all world energy last year as renewable energy development remains slow and costly. Renewables make up 12% of power generation. Coal contributed the most to power generation with 35%. And guess what? Almost every nation and every energy company that was committed to going green is now backtracking and increasing their dependency on oil and their production of oil.

**NUCLEAR** – Don’t look now nuclear but you are quickly becoming the new darling of clean energy, here in the US, and around the globe. So much so that the Greenies are now claiming you as one of their own. I it because you’re far more reliable and cost effective?? Maybe. Even the little noise box, Greta the Green, is embracing you. It seems like only a year ago (because it was) that she claimed you as one of the energy sources that was responsible for ruining her childhood.

**RENEWABLES** – While the heat dome sat over Texas last week, power plants were maxing out, sending out emergency notices and asking the residential sector to minimize their usage. The main factor for this problem is that nuclear and coal power generation has shrunk in Texas, giving way to nonhydroelectric renewables (mainly wind). One big problem in this strategy - anyone who has spent time in the Lone Star State during the summer can tell you there is no wind. The air is stagnant. A soft breeze is but a dream. It is a stifling heat that does not move. So instead of addressing this known FACT with increased natgas production specifically for power generation, or increased nuclear specifically for power generation, the imbeciles put in charge of power generation and grid management for Texas (consumes more energy than any other state), choose to go with windmills. You that’s the reason that the residential co-gen market is so good in Texas?

**ITEMS OF INTEREST **– I recently read an article that stated the following factual numbers about fossil to renewable transition. It warrants reiteration. The world uses 4.5 billion tons of cement, 1.8 billion tons of steel, 400 million tons of plastic, and 180 million tons of ammonia. All these products are produced by using fossil fuels. So far, no one pushing renewable only energy has come up with a way to continue manufacturing these products without using fossil fuels. In the U.S. alone, we have nearly 280 million vehicles currently in use. If we were to move these vehicles to EV only, we would need over 12.5 billion tons of material to be mined, transported, and produced around the globe to manufacture the EV battery alone. For the US to electrify our US vehicles we will need to expand our power generation by 72% - producing more power, transmitting the power, and distributing the power to newly built sub stations. You think you’re being taxed too much now? Just wait until you must pay for this overhaul that will never meet the growing energy demands of the U.S. and the world.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – Temperatures are increasing. Cooling demand is increasing. LNG exports are increasing. Demand for natgas is increasing. Natgas production is decreasing. Which way do you think pricing will move?

**STORAGE REPORT**

The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 91Bcf. The actual number comes in at 95Bcf. We're now 571Bcf higher than this time last year and 362Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,367Bcf. At 2,729Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range.

**WEATHER – **The July/August/September forecast is calling for above normal temperatures across the US except for the northern Plains region. That’s enough to keep NYMEX prices up. Here in the West, the 10 – 15 day forecast calls for temperatures to be well above normal. That should keep Basis prices up. Weather is a major factor in both NYMEX and Basis pricing and for those who forgot this, here comes your reminder.
