***THE ENERGY UPDATE for 8-7-23***

---

*Does NYMEX even pay attention to weather, demand, and supply these days? It certainly is today!*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX** – NYMEX prices are up $0.10 from 1 week ago but down approximately $5.40 from 1 year ago. The prompt month is up as much as $0.17 at $2.75. With resistance levels between $2.65 - $2.75 and support levels being all the way down around the $2.40 to $2.50 range, it’s safe to say we could be staring into a decent bull run. NYMEX is paying attention to the driving factors and so should you!

**BASIS** – Basis in the West region remains higher than normal and may continue to remain higher than normal for the foreseeable future due to above normal temperatures & humidity, a growing demand at power plants, a lack of pipeline options (intrastate or interstate coming west), and a lack of in-state production and storage.

**RIG COUNT** – Last week’s rig count for natgas is unchanged from the previous week with 128 active rigs for natgas. Active oil rigs fell by 4 for a total of 525 rigs currently seeking oil.

**PRODUCTION** – U.S. Natgas production continues to stay around the 100/101Bcf range.

**DEMAND** – U.S. domestic demand is on the rise due to increased and extended cooling demand days. Overseas demand (LNG) shows no signs of lessening for the time being.

**RETAIL POWER (CALIFORNIA)** – Power prices here in California fell as much as $10, from $70 per MWH two weeks ago to just over $60 per MWH last week. Power prices continue to be driven by natural gas prices here in the West.

\*\*CARBON OFFSETS and RSG (responsibly sourced gas) – \*\*We’ve got both carbon offsets and now RSG if you want them. The menu length is too long to post on the weekly energy update. Call us and we can send them out to you and discuss further.

**CRUDE** – **U.S. commercial crude** inventories fell by a record -17 million barrels from July 21 – July 28, 2023. As part of their effort to boost oil prices, Saudi and its “allies” in OPEC have been especially keen to drain U.S. inventories because they are the most visible part of the oil market. Following the drawdown, U.S. commercial crude inventories were just +9 million barrels above the prior ten-year seasonal average. We the People (at the pump) pay the price for us failing to be more independent when it comes to energy. And our DOE has the gall to say warmer than normal weather is to blame for higher prices at the pump….

**NUCLEAR** – Alberta, Canada is suspending green energy projects (solar & wind) and looking closer into SMRs. Seeing as Alberta has an average of 55% of sunshine, and the combined S&W energy contributed a meager 17% of all energy last year, it makes sense to look at nuclear and SMRs. It seems that people are pulling their heads out of the sand and making the smarter choice to choose nuclear over S&W. China (of all places) is leading the charge. South Korea, India, and Japan are all looking to nuclear in their fight towards climate change. Makes sense. Now get hydrogen going and we’ll make a section for that energy source on here as well.

**RENEWABLES** – Mongolia and the U.S have agreed that Mongolia will “deepen their cooperation of mining rare earths” for the U.S. to meet our growing push of EVs here in the U.S. Nothing to see here! Look away, please. Just some standard, hypocritical NIMBY being practiced.

\*\*ITEMS OF INTEREST \*\*– Bullish factors across the board right now. Is it better to be long or better to be short when the driving factors look more bullish than bearish? The answer, in my opinion, is to be long. Especially here in the West. We have seen delivered daily spot prices during summer months spike over $20 per MMBtu and over $150 per MMBtu during winter months. We have not seen any delivered daily spot prices fall from the $5 - $6 range down to the $2 - $1 range. And that is why a longer position beats a short position. It’s that simple, people!

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – Let the other traders and suppliers over complicate and confuse you with their nonsensical industry blathering. That’s how they keep you scared and afraid to leave them. RFP ES is ripping away the fear and confusion in the market. You have far better options than you know. Just ask any of our clients if they’re happier with us than their former supplier/trader. They will say “yes”. Ask them if they have a clearer picture of the current and forward markets now than they did in the past with their former supplier/trader. They will say “yes”. Ask them if they’re afraid of being blindsided by market price spikes because they went into extreme months/seasons with no plan in place. They will say “no”.

\*\*STORAGE REPORT – \*\*The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 18Bcf. The actual number comes in at 14Bcf. We're now 550Bcf higher than this time last year and 322Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,679Bcf. At 3,001Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season level forecast remains at 4.0Tcf.

\*\*WEATHER – \*\*The 3-month forecast is above normal for the South, increasing an already high cooling demand. The Oct – Dec ’23 outlook shows above normal conditions for the West and Northeast, with slightly above normal for most of the U.S. except for the Plains and West Great Lakes regions (where “equal chances” are forecasted) paints a bearish forecast. The 6–10-day forecast shows temps above normal for SoCal, well above normal for Texas, South, Southeast, and up to the Mid-Atlantic. The 5-day to 15-day forecast favors higher prices as more heat drives up cooling demand.
