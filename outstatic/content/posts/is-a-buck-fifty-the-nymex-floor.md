***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $1.77/$1.86. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $1.768. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $1.72/$1.67. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E CG Basis prices are down a few cents while SoCal CG Basis is up a few cents. *

***LNG EXPORTS, NG EXPORTS, NG IMPORTS ****– LNG exports hit 10.8Bcf/D yesterday. Some believe it could drop to single digits by Friday. Exports to Mexico = 6.0Bcf/D. Imports from Canada = 5.3Bcf. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 103.1Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 104.1Bcf. Today’s Est. Production = 98.5Bcf. *

*Today’s Est. Demand = 89.9Bcf. Latest Demand 7 Day Avg. = 93.2Bcf. 7-day Demand forecast remains low through Thursday then moves to high. *

***RIG COUNT ****– By the numbers – 2023 fell 20% from 2022. 2022 was up 33% from 2021. And 2021 was up 67% from 2020. The most recent oil rig count fell by 2 to 506 active rigs. The natural gas rig count fell by 1 to 109 active rigs. *

***STORAGE**** – Bearish storage levels are increasing. Storage is expected to finish the injection season between 3.9Tcf and 4.0Tcf. We are 435Bcf above this time last year and 633Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,650Bcf. At 2,283Bcf, we are above the 5-year historical range. *

***WEATHER**** – *[*NatGasWeather.com*](http://NatGasWeather.com)* has this to say for the next 6 days, “Weather systems will impact many areas of the US over the next few days w/showers, temperatures w/highs of 50s-80s. 90s in the Southwest deserts and S. Texas. Cooler vs normal weather systems will impact the northern, central, and eastern US Fri-Mon w/rain, snow, and chilly lows of upper 20s and 30s, highs of 40s-60s for stronger national demand.” *

*5 – 10-day forecast = bullish. 10-15-day forecast = bullish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer (June – Aug) forecast = bullish. *

***CRUDE –**** Up. Current price = $85.42. Forward estimates: 2024 = $83.18, 2025 = $76.53, 2026 = $71.70. *****

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – CAISO just over $38 per MWH. Up $8 per MWH from 1 week ago.*

***CARBON OFFSETS –**** We’re going to see a lot of carbon offsets coming out of Africa as their government finally gets serious about implementing “clean cooking” mandates/projects. If you’re looking to buy carbon offsets, many of our Supply Partners offer carbon offset menus (type of carbon offset, price per unit, etc.) for review and purchase.*

***RENEWABLE ENERGY**** – ERCOT is asking power generators to cancel planned outages this week due to a strong increase in cooling demand expected this week. *

***THE BOTTOM LINE ****– The “experts” are saying $1.50 is the absolute floor for NYMEX. We’re approximately $0.20 from that bottom price right now for May ’24. On the upside, they are saying once we hit the $2.00 mark, $2.50 will soon follow. Outside of May ’24 and June ’24, NYMEX is already above $2.00/$2.50 marks. Sone of you holding out for $1.50 or even sub $1.50, could end up paying well above those target prices if (when) summer bulls show up.*
