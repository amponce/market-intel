\
In January 2024, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) set a new winter record for natural gas-fired electricity generation, reaching an impressive 49.4 gigawatts (GW) during a three-day cold snap. \
\
This surpasses the previous winter record of 48.8 GW from December 2022 and is just shy of the summer peak of 51.2 GW recorded in August 2023.\
\
ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:\
Peak Hour: January 16, 2024, at 7:00 PM Central Time.\
Winter Record: 49.4 GW, a 1% increase from the previous record.\
\
Summer Comparison: Within 4% of the summer high of 51.2 GW.\
\
In Texas, electricity demand peaks during summer heat waves and winter cold snaps. To meet this demand, ERCOT relies heavily on dispatchable natural gas-fired generation, which supplied 56% of all electricity during the recent cold snap, compared to an average of 46% for January 2024. The decline in wind and solar output, coupled with increased heating needs, drove this surge.\
ðŸ”¹ Daily Statistics:\
Natural Gas Generation: 986.2GWh on January 16, 2024, a 72% increase from the January average.\
Record Consumption: Texas power sector consumed 8.6Bcf/d of natural gas on January 15, 2024.\
Despite challenges such as weather-related disruptions and maintenance, Texas maintained sufficient natural gas supplies due to robust weatherization standards implemented after Winter Storm Uri in 2021. These measures have fortified critical infrastructure against extreme weather, ensuring reliability during peak demands.\
ERCOT's performance during this period underscores the critical role of natural gas in Texas's energy landscape, particularly during extreme weather conditions.\
