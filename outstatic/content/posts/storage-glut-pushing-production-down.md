***WEATHER**** – *[*NatGasWeather.com*](http://NatGasWeather.com)* has this to say for the next 6 days, “A weather systems will impact the East Fri-Sat w/showers and thunderstorms. Although, temperatures will be quite comfortable over the northern US w/highs 50s to near 70F, while very nice to warm over the southern US w/highs of 60s-80s, locally 90s. Next week will be very nice over the US w/highs of 50s-80s.”*

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – CAISO just over $23 per MWH. Down over $7 per MWH from 1 week ago.*

***CARBON OFFSETS –**** We’re going to see a lot of carbon offsets coming out of Africa as their government finally gets serious about implementing “clean cooking” mandates/projects. If you’re looking to buy carbon offsets, many of our Supply Partners offer carbon offset menus (type of carbon offset, price per unit, etc.) for review and purchase.*

***RENEWABLE ENERGY**** – As electricity demand continues to set records here in the US and around the world, where is all this extra energy going to come from and how will the current grids handle the increased demand going forward?? Not well if history is anything to go by…*

***THE BOTTOM LINE ****– Leaving this up from last week as it still stands for the start of this week. The driving factors/fundamentals remain bearish in the short term. However, here are a few driving factors that show up every summer, bringing the bulls with them; heatwaves driving cooling demand days above normal, pipeline maintenance, and with limited pipeline optionality in the West, we are exposed to potential transportation (basis) price spikes. Keep these in mind when you find yourself chasing (what you believe is) the bottom of the market. *
