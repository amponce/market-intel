🌍 THE One Minute Energy Update for 8-1-24 🔋

Today's Highlights: 📉 Coal Prices: Expected to drop by 28% in 2024 and another 12% in 2025. Despite record consumption, mainly by China and India, adding 220Mmt. Interestingly, China plans to import an additional 150Mmt for manufacturing windmills and solar panels. Oh, the irony! 🏭🔄

🔻 Europe's NatGas Demand: Hitting a 2-decade low thanks to renewable energy and nuclear power. 🌱⚡

💼 AI Data Centers: Rapid expansion in the U.S. They're increasingly relying on natural gas for power due to cost and reliability, despite the push for green energy. 🤖🔋

💷 Bank of England: Cuts interest rates from 5.25% to 5% for the first time in four years. Will the US follow? 🇬🇧➡️🇺🇸
