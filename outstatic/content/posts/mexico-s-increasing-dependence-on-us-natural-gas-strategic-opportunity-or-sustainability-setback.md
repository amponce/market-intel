Mexico's energy landscape is undergoing significant transformations, with natural gas playing a pivotal role. The country's increasing reliance on natural gas imports from the United States has raised critical questions about the strategic and sustainability implications of this dependency. This report examines whether Mexico's growing dependence on US natural gas represents a strategic opportunity or a sustainability setback, considering the geopolitical, economic, and environmental dimensions of this relationship.\
\
**Mexico's Natural Gas Dependency: An Overview**\
\
Mexico imported an average of 5.7Bcf/d of gas from Texas in 2023, with projections indicating that US gas imports could account for approximately 79% of Mexican gas supply by 2050, up from 68% in 2023 (S&P Global Commodity Insights). This trend is driven by the critical role that natural gas plays in Mexico's power system and industrial sector, where it accounted for 63 percent and 33 percent of demand respectively in 2022 (Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy).\
\
**Strategic Opportunities**\
Economic Benefits and Energy Security\
\
The availability of cheap and abundant US natural gas has historically provided Mexico with significant economic benefits. It has enabled the country to meet its growing energy demands while keeping energy costs relatively low, thus supporting industrial growth and economic competitiveness. The integration of the North American energy markets has also enhanced energy security for Mexico, providing a reliable and steady supply of natural gas (Natural Gas Intelligence).\
\
**Nearshoring and Industrial Growth**\
\
The nearshoring trend, which involves relocating production facilities closer to the United States, benefits significantly from Mexico's access to US natural gas. This geographical and economic proximity offers a strategic advantage, making Mexico an attractive destination for industries that rely heavily on natural gas, such as manufacturing and chemicals (Mexico Business News).\
\
**Sustainability Setbacks**\
Environmental Concerns\
\
While natural gas is cleaner than coal or oil, it is still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases. Mexico's heavy reliance on natural gas from the US could hinder its ability to transition to more sustainable energy sources like solar and wind. This dependency also exposes Mexico to risks associated with methane leakage and other environmental impacts associated with natural gas production and transportation (Mexico Business News).\
\
**Vulnerability to Supply Disruptions**\
\
Mexico's dependency on a single external source for a majority of its natural gas needs makes it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions. Historical events such as the 2021 Winter Storm Uri have already demonstrated how such dependencies can lead to significant energy shortages and economic disruptions (Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy).\
\
**Delayed Development of Domestic Resources**\
\
The ease of access to US natural gas has also led to underinvestment in Mexico's own natural gas resources. Despite having substantial reserves, particularly in the Burgos Basin, Mexico has not developed the necessary infrastructure or regulatory frameworks to exploit these resources effectively. This has resulted in missed opportunities for domestic energy development and job creation (Center for Strategic & International Studies).\
\
**Conclusion**\
\
Mexico's growing dependence on US natural gas presents both strategic opportunities and sustainability challenges. While the economic and energy security benefits are significant, the long-term sustainability implications cannot be overlooked. To mitigate these risks, Mexico needs to diversify its energy sources, invest in renewable energy technologies, and develop its domestic natural gas resources. This balanced approach will not only enhance Mexico's energy security but also support its transition to a more sustainable energy future.\
