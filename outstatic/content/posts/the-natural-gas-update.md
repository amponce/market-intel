***THE NATURAL GAS UPDATE for 2-24-23***



*“THE WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART” T. PETTY *

THE driving FACTORS

**NYMEX **– NYMEX prices got close to record lows this week. We shouldn’t be foolish enough to think that these record low prices will last forever. The prompt month (March ’23) is down $7 per MMBtu since we saw a $9 prompt month for Aug ’23. We need to lock them up in the next few weeks. If you think you can beat the market, then go for it. But remember – betting on something we can’t control is a bad bet.

**BASIS** – We have a few pipelines under scheduled maintenance right now that are supposed to see completion by the first week of March ’23. As of yesterday, there is talk of the scheduled maintenance completion being pushed out to the first week of April. Pair that with the current weather forecast for the West remaining below normal and it looks like we will have to wait a few more weeks before Shoulder Season pricing shows up.

**RIG COUNT** – This week’s rig count shows oil rigs falling by 7 to a total of 600, while natgas rigs remain unchanged at 151 active rigs.

**PRODUCTION** – There is a production surplus taking place right now as most of the U.S. lounges through balmy winter temps. We can’t be certain that this surplus will last for 2 reasons; weather changes, demand increases, and producers can always shut in production to get prices back to a level where producers aren’t losing money producing more natgas.

**DEMAND** – Demand across the US is down due to milder than normal weather – roughly half compared to the past 10 winters. Once demand increases, we can expect prices to increase. There in the West, however, heating demand days are increasing for the next few weeks and that may delay what many believe will be a good time to execute fixed prices. Summer strips, 12-month strips, and even 24- or 36-month strips may be coming up soon, depending on your targeted price range and budget. Don’t be the fool who holds on for another $0.10 drop in price when prices fall. Take the winnings and move on. Let’s not forget that LNG exports will also be increasing and that could add significant support to higher prices.

**CRUDE** – Crude has been bouncing around the $70’s all week, oil stocks are falling, prices at the pump are down from the recent high of June ’22, but still up 40% from 2 years ago. The “experts” believe that prices are going back up due to a growing demand that is outpacing world production and supply.

**NUCLEAR** – We need more of it while we wait for RE to step up. However, the bigger problem is this – our national and state electric grids are wildly outdated and poorly managed/maintained. We have all the power in the world but if the grid can’t handle the excess supply to meet the growing demand, it’s time once more for candles. What’s your favorite scent?? I guess it really depends on the time of year, doesn’t it?

**RENEWABLES** – This energy source is like that slack jawed contractor we’ve all had at one time or another, “yeah…well….it’s gonna take a little while longer and gonna cost a little more money than what we first figured on…..”. In the meantime, let’s keep the reliable energy sources available, shall we?



**ITEMS OF INTEREST **– Natgas is now cheaper to use than coal, plus the ramp up and ramp down time for natgas versus coal, is more energy efficient. So, it looks like natgas demand will increase even more.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – NYMEX natgas is cheap right now. Basis at the West region delivery points need to fall back to an historical range. That fall could happen once the cold front moves east, once the scheduled maintenance is complete, and before cooling demand days kick in. We should have our window of opportunity but it won’t be open for long. Be ready.
