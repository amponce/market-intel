**ITEMS OF INTEREST **

[RFPES.com](http://RFPES.com) is the main item of interest! My partners and I believe we have the best possible approach for the end user to procure natgas, for the broker/consultant to submit RFPS, and for suppliers to review/bid on RFPs fit their business model.

For now, the delivery points we’re performing RFPs behind are PG&E, SoCal Gas, SWG Nevada, and SWG Arizona.

More delivery points, regions, and energy products are coming in Q2 and Q3 of 2023. We understand the level of excitement you’re experiencing hearing this news and we’re every bit as excited to bring it to you.

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – The recent volatility experienced in the West during Dec ’22, Jan ’23, and most likely in Feb ’23 as well, is all the evidence we need to know that this can happen again with little to no warning. To protect ourselves from such violent volatility, fixed prices, layered fixed prices, triggers to fix, appear to be the smartest option for now.

### **NATURAL GAS PRICING**

Indicative Fixed Prices as of 1/27/2023

Start Date Term PG&E CG SoCal CG

March ’23 1 mo. $17.06 $17.09

March ’23 3 mo. $8.61 $9.31

#### **STORAGE REPORT**

The latest storage report shows a pull of 91Bcf while guesstimates late yesterday were 7Bcf below the actual pull. NYMEX reacts by falling even further, falling below $3.00. We are now 107Bcf HIGHER than this time last year and 128Bcf ABOVE the 5-year average. At 2,279Bcf, we are well within the 5-year historical range.

**WEATHER**

If the below forecast moves north into Canada, we might experience one of the mildest winters on record. And with that said, will hydro be all but depleted, setting us up for a summer that could be even more dependent on natgas than usual? Maybe…maybe not…want to roll the dice and find out?
