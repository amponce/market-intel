***THE NATURAL GAS UPDATE for 4-6-23***



*Happy Easter, Happy Passover, Happy Masters, and Happy Long Weekend to those who have no idea what the first three “Happy”s are!*

THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX **– EIA had this to say in their most recent short term energy outlook –** “**As a result of less natural gas consumption than we had expected, we forecast that the United States will close the withdrawal season at the end of March with more than 1.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in storage, 23% more than the five-year average and 27% more than we forecast in the January STEO. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price in our forecast averages about $3 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2023, down by more than 50% from last year. We had expected almost $5/MMBtu in the January STEO forecast.”.

We are almost $1.00 below their recent downward correction on the 2023 average. NYMEX averaged $3.91 in 2021, $6.42 in 2022, is expected to average $3.02 in 2023, and average $3.89 in 2024. If you want perspective on whether to hedge NYMEX futures right now, look at the 20-year NYMEX chart.

**BASIS** – Time to play the broken record again. Basis remains well above historical averages and should remain in this range while we wait for substantial capacity to come back online and in-state storage to build up. That capacity is expected to come back on over the next 4 weeks. Feel free to voice your displeasure of Basis prices (ranging from $3.00 per MMBtu for May ’23 to as high as $7.50 per MMBtu for Jan ’24) to your local SoCalGas representative. And let me emphasize that these are BASIS ONLY prices. NYMEX is not included. BTW – PG&E CG First of the Month April ‘23 Index came in around $6.88 while SoCal CG First of the Month Index for April ’23 came in around $7.88.

**RIG COUNT** – The latest rig count fell by 3 rigs, creating the first quarterly drop in rigs since 2020. The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell to 755 in the week of March 31. Despite the week's rig decline, Baker Hughes said the total count was still up 82 rigs (+12%), over this time last year.



**PRODUCTION** – U.S. nat-gas production as of Monday was at 100.1Bcf, up +5.1% y/y. In addition, nat-gas prices are under pressure as the ongoing delay to restart full operations at the Freeport LNG export terminal helps boost U.S. nat-gas stockpiles as exports are curtailed. 2023 daily production is set to average over 100Bcf.

**DEMAND** – EIA expects U.S natural gas consumption to average 99.1Bcf/d in the first quarter of 2023 (1Q23), down 5% from 1Q of 2022. The decline in consumption is the result of very mild temperatures that have reduced demand for space heating. The largest decline is in residential and commercial consumption, which we expect will be 11% less in 1Q of 2023 than in 1Q of 2022. That soft winter lack of heating demand could be wiped out early with above normal, and early, cooling demand days.

**CRUDE** – OPEC has chosen to cut production as of May ’23. Bullish movement is already being seen with a 1-day jump, the largest jump in over a year. Just in time for summer travel. WHAT a coincidence! Two weeks ago, we were sitting around $70 a barrel for WTI Crude. That same barrel started this week out at $80 a barrel and remains around $80 at the time of this report. OPEC didn’t even shy away from the reason why they were cutting back production – to take down the people trading the black gold. OPEC doesn’t like ANY other source but themselves setting the price of oil. Nothing to fear there, right? Right?!

**NUCLEAR** – We currently have 92 nuclear reactors here in the US, with a capacity of nearly 95GW. 41 nuclear related sites have been closed over the years and 42 projects over the years have simply been abandoned here in the US. To keep the lights on, we are going to have to accept the fact that as much as we may fear nuclear plants (especially when operated by the government or local utility company) we fear high energy prices and blackouts far more. Europe already learned their lesson on going fully green well before they could. Can we PLEASE start to learn from others’ mistakes? America loves to take things from Europe such as cars, fashion, food, the list goes on. How about we take a lesson from their stupidity?

**RENEWABLES** – Still waiting for this group to make a real impact when it comes to meeting C&I demand. California Hydro may have an impact this spring/summer as we endured record setting rainfall and snowpacks the past few months. Let’s see how well those in charge here in the Golden State manage the expected excess hydro levels this year.

**ITEMS OF INTEREST **– Our great state leaders here in California approved regulatory caps on refining products this past Monday. This was brought on by many of our state leaders accusing refineries of price gouging in California. How many other states are making such accusations? This probably won’t end well for the end user in CA who already pays the highest price for gasoline in the US – maybe it has something to do with the $1.25+ per gallon in taxes and fees. Most likely, it will only drive prices higher in CA and here’s why I say that – in 1982 we had 43 active refineries in CA. We now have 13 active refineries. Refineries have chosen to leave CA, taking away intra state production and further limiting California’s self-reliance on energy. California also implemented the CA Special Blend for gasoline decades ago that demands refineries blend down the gasoline coming into CA to improve the air quality. With the way cars have been built over the past 20 to 30 years, a special blend of gasoline does little to nothing to improve air quality, yet we still insist on this more expensive, do little special blend. This continued stupidity will only further limit any refinery from wanting to sell gasoline to California. Some of us may recall the very early days of the 2000’s when a former CA governor chose to cap the price of megawatt hours (MWh). How did that turn out for power prices, power availability, power procurement optionality, and finally, job security for that governor? Not too good if memory serves and my memory always serves!

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – Lest we forget, allow me to remind everyone here in the West region – the higher our natural gas prices are, the higher our power prices will be. Natural gas remains the dominant energy source for CA power generation. A strong jump in Hydro supplies this year could lessen natural gas demand by as much as 5%. That could help push Basis prices back closer to historical pricing ranges. We are at the end of the line here in California when it comes to energy optionality and there are no signs of it improving. So, when we see a strong downward movement, we had better take advantage of it. If you want to play the daily spot and index games in late summer and winter, that’s on you.

#### **STORAGE REPORT**

The last forecast for the storage withdrawal, that I saw, was 45Bcf. The actual number comes in at 23Bcf. Well below estimates and NYMEX is responding with downward price movement. We're now 443Bcf higher than this time last year and 298Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,532Bcf. At 1,830Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. Here in California, however, we’re still about 50% below where we should be for this time of year regarding storage levels. We’ve begun injecting ahead of other regions and will need to max out storage earlier than later if we are to get Basis back to the historical ranges.

**WEATHER**

Winter seems to be behind us now and NYMEX is taking notice. Now and the next few weeks could be the cheapest yet for NYMEX, before any early cooling demand days add support to higher NYMEX and Basis prices. We know what to do in these situations. The next two weeks may be our Shoulder Season.
