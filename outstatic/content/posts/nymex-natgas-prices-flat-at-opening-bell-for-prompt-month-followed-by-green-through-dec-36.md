***#STORAGE*** *– We are currently 209Bcf higher than this time last year and 375Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,889Bcf.  At 3,264Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range.  The latest Storage projections for Oct ’24 range between 3.87Tcf – 4.03Tcf.  The March ’25 estimate is 1.63Tcf – 1.95Tcf.* 

***#CRUDE – Down.***  *Current Cash price = $73.43.  Forward Estimates: 2024 = $72.89, 2025 = $69.80, 2026 = $67.05.*

***#CAISO and #CALIFORNIARETAILPOWER*** *– Grid Status = Normal.  CAISO current pricing = $21 - $32.*

***#HURRICANE SEASON UPDATE*** *– All clear.  No storms to report on.*      

***#WEATHER*** *– Hot and high pressure remain in the SW and Texas.  Hot streak runs from the Badlands to Miami.  The east coast will enjoy below normal temperatures today and tomorrow.  The rest of the US will be slightly above normal but nothing to freak out over.  Next week most of this glorious republic will warm to above normal.*    

***Today*** *= Bearish.  **5 – 10-day Forecast** = Bullish. 10-**15-day Forecast** = Bullish.*

***Sep – Nov Forecast*** *= Bullish.  Oct **– Dec Forecast** = Bearish.  **Dec ’24 – Feb ’25** = Bearish.*

***#CARBONOFFSETS –*** *California and other states will be mandating companies buy carbon offsets, starting as early as 2025.  Is your company ready for that mandate?  Better to get ahead of the 2025 demand – more options, greater price range.  We can help.* 

***THE BOTTOM LINE*** *– Remember a few years ago when we were saying daily production needs to be at or above 100Bcf to limit upside price movement, as well as meet increased LNG export demand?  We were 100% accurate.  Now, we’re going to move that daily production up to 105Bcf/D for 2025 to combat the same 2 issues.  If we can’t increase the daily average by 4Bcf in the next year, expect prices to increase as much as 30%.*
