***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/16/24***

***\#NYMEXDown #PG&ECGBasisBULLISH #SoCalGasBasisBULLISH #Weather #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– Prompt month is down considerably today. Weather remains the main driving factor. *

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****open = $3.11, high = 3.18, low = $2.90, currently @ $2.96 NYMEX prices are up approximately $0.20 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.55 from 1 year ago. *

*We are above the 50-day ($2.80) and the 20-day ($2.77), and below the 9-day ($3.05) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.98, 2025 = $3.65, 2026 = $3.86. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $3.42/$3.53. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $3.26*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $3.15/$2.98. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 110.8Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 109.8Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 104.2Bcf/D. Demand expected to be high from 1-16-24 to 1-22-24. *

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 131.248Bcf. Today’s expected demand = 138.9Bcf.*

***BASIS**** – Both PG&E CG and SoCal Basis remain well above the historical range for now. We should see a strong downward correction by this time next week. Burn the last 5 days of volatility into your memory. It happens and if you’re contracted on open (daily spot/First of the Month Indexes) positions, you could get burned on astronomically prices. *

*The PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. The SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. The SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – latest report shows 14.7Bcf/D. As demand across the globe falls and projects continue to increase, we could be looking at an LNG oversupply by year’s end. Could be bearish for C&I natural gas market.*

***RIG COUNT – ****The first rig count of 2024 (1-12-24) = 619. Oil rose by 2 rigs to 499 while the natural gas rig count fell by 1 to 117. The miscellaneous rig count is 3. *

***WEATHER**** – Cold across the U.S. except for Florida and SoCal. Frigid temperatures overnight. 6 – 10-day forecast = bearish. 10-15-day forecast = bearish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – The expected withdrawal from Storage this Thursday is 304Bcrf. If it hits, it will be the 3rd largest withdrawal in history. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****Weather is turning in our favor once again and we should see both NYMEX and Basis fall dramatically by this time next week. Be ready to execute because we have seen that we never know when the market will turn on dramatically.******Buying 100% tolerance can turn out to be a very good thing. *
