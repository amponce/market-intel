***THE 1 Minute Energy Report for 10/30/23***

***\#NYMEX #NYMEXSeeingRed #PG&EBasisUpAgain #SoCalBasisUpAgain ***

***\#ColdFrontMovingEast #EnergyRogue***

***NYMEX**** – Nov ’23 is off the board and Dec ’23 moves into prompt month. For the first time in 5 days, NYMEX opens on the downside. Today’s opening price for Dec ‘23 = $3.40, high = $3.40, low = $3.32, currently sitting @ $3.33. This wipes out Friday’s rally. Dec ’23 is down as much as up around $0.08 so far today. NYMEX prices are up $0.10 from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.30 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – Provided by the fine people at *[*EnergyRogue.com*](http://EnergyRogue.com)* (a great source for energy related information) - 2023 Balance = $3.32, 2024 = $3.49, 2025 = $4.04. *

***RESISTANCE**** –Starting @ $3.55/$3.65. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $3.44/$3.35. *

***PRODUCTION & DEMAND**** – Production – Up to 102.6Bcf/D, up 0.1Bcf from last week. Supply as of 10-30-23 = 107.9Bcf. Last year = 102.2Bcf/D. 3 yr. avg. = 97.2Bcf/D.*

* Demand – 7-day average = 97.4Bcf, down 1.6Bcf from last week.*

***RIG COUNT ****– The oil & gas rig count increased for the third straight week. Friday’s rig count = + 2 for oil with a total of 504 active oil rigs. Last week’s natural gas rig count = - 1 for a total of 117 active natural gas rigs. *

***BASIS**** – Both PG&E Basis and SoCal Basis are up today. We have seen Basis prices move up and down, as much as $2.00 in either direction, over the past few weeks. Today’s upturn could be short lived as the weather patterns improve and cooling and heating demand falls. Now we just need more options in the West, more production across the US, and for wind and solar to start putting out their promised supply levels – that should happen right after the Cleveland Browns win the Super Bowl….*

***LNG**** – Latest export report = 13.7Bc/D for 2023, down 0.6Bcf from last week’s average. The “experts” expect LNG exports to increase by 12.9Bcf/D over the next 5 years. *

***WEATHER**** – Last week’s cold front from the Pac NW is now stretching out over the Rockies, Plains, Mid-Con, and even Texas. It will be gone before you know it as the 6–10-day forecast shows well above normal temperatures for the Pac NW, West, Rockies, SW, and Texas. Slightly above normal temperatures for most of the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast. Close to normal for the Great Lakes and New East regions. The 10 – 15 forecast shows above normal temperatures for the Pac NW, West, Rockies, Texas, and Gulf regions. Near normal temperatures forecasted for the Mid-Con, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Slightly below normal temperatures for New England.*

***STORAGE**** – Implied daily injections = 10.5Bcf. End of season storage estimates = 3.8Tcf. *
