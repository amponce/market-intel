***NYMEX**** – NYMEX jumped nearly 7% yesterday to a 9-month high. Colder than normal weather across the Mid-Con was all that was needed for an overbought market. Those who over bought were able to salvage some overpriced positions yesterday. Today’s opening price for Dec ‘23 = $3.60 ($0.27 higher than yesterday’s opening price), high = $3.60, low = $3.42, currently sitting @ $3.50. Dec ’23 is down as much as $0.18 so far today. NYMEX prices are up $0.50 from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.70 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2023 Balance = $3.57, 2024 = $3.60, 2025 = $4.09. *

***RESISTANCE**** –Starting @ $3.69/$3.82. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $3.38/$3.19. *

***WEATHER**** – Warming up across the northern half of the U.S. while the southern half gets a little cooler but not enough to initiate any real heating demand. The 6 – 10 day show above normal temperatures for the West, SW, Texas, and Gulf regions, with near normal for everywhere else but New England and the Lakes regions where it’s scheduled to be slightly below normal. The 10-15-day forecast continues to show well above normal temperatures from Seattle to New Orleans. Near normal for the Mid-Con. Below normal for the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and New England. *

***STORAGE**** – Implied daily injections = 10.5Bcf. End of season storage estimates = 3.8Tcf. The latest estimate for tomorrow’s storage report is an injection of 83Bcf. Compare this to 99Bcf injected last year for this week and the 5-year average of 57Bcf.*
