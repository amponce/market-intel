***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/4/24***

***\#ReturnOfTheBottomLine #NYMEXUpAgain #PG&ECGBasisUp #SoCalGasBasisUp #WeatherDrivingBullRun #SoftStorageWithdrawal #ProductionUp #DemandDown #StorageStrong #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– The CURRENT weather system continues to drive prices up. All other driving factors are bearish so this rally should end once the weather blows through.*

***Today’s opening NYMEX price for Feb ‘24**** = $2.68, high = $2.85, low = $2.68, currently sitting @ $2.74. NYMEX prices are up approximately $0.20 from 1 week ago and down approximately $1.20 from 1 year ago. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.84) and are above the 20-day ($2.52) and the 9-day ($2.60) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.73, 2025 = $3.53, 2026 = $3.83. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. *

*2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.75/$2.85. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.60/$2.53. *

***BASIS**** – In case you missed this, we’ll keep this up through this week - We expect Demand to increase this Spring and Summer in the SW region. An increase in demand in the SW will most likely drive Basis prices up throughout California. The reason(s) for this – increased demand with numerous new facilities coming online in the SW region, increasing natural gas demand, as well as higher than normal temperatures being forecasted (at this time) for both seasons. We have seen Basis prices tank in the past few weeks. Let’s take advantage of this while we can. Call myself or Ricco Washington directly to get on this now. *

*Both PG&E Basis and SoCal CG Basis are up significantly today. As we said earlier this morning, “We have good storage, record setting production, demand is down (below average), importing is good, and exporting is steady.” We should see bears return in just over a week. *

*PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. *

*SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. *

*SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

*Current fixed price offers for 2024 – 2026 are all lower than the 2023 Index prices. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 109.5Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 109.55Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 105.3Bcf/D. Demand expected to be moderate over the next 7 days.*

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 126.6Bcf. Today’s expected demand = 134.3Bcf.*

***RIG COUNT – End of year rig count = ****622, down 20.15% from 1 year ago. Oil rose by 2 rigs to 500 while natural gas rigs count closed the year at 120 rigs, and miscellaneous rigs finished 2023 with 2. 2023 showed a drop in rig counts in all 4 quarters. Despite the drop in rigs, natgas production continues to set records. *

***WEATHER**** – Chilly temperatures throughout the U.S. today. Bullish 6 – 10-day forecast. Bullish 10-15-day forecast. Bearish 3-month forecast. Bullish Summer forecast.*

***STORAGE**** – Today’s storage report estimate was a withdrawal of 50Bcf. The actual report comes in with a 14Bcf withdrawal. Why even bother asking these “experts” for their guesstimate anymore? They’re basically throwing darts blindly and blind tossing is never a good thing. Remove the idiocy. So, we are now 553Bcf higher than we were last year and 399Bcf above the 5-year average 3,077Bcf. At 3,476Bcf, we are above the 5-year historical range.*

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – CAISO sitting just above $53. That’s $10 higher than 2 days ago. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE - ****We’ve been here before. There is a bull run taking place due to some winter weather finally showing up. It should be gone in a week or two and a downward price correction should take place. Until then, we review our volume, terms, and be ready to attack when the bears return.*****
