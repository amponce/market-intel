***THE 1 Minute Energy Report for 10/26/23***

***\#NYMEX #NYMEXUpSlightly #PG&EBasisFalling #SoCalBasisFalling #ProductionDown***

***\#Weather ***

***Before we jump into THE 1 Minute Energy Report for today, let’s look at something taking place. Exxon Mobil buys Pioneer for $60 billion. Chevron buys Hess for $53billion. It is very clear that fossil fuel is not going away any time soon. Quite the opposite. But in the meantime, while our public servants push the gullible consumer towards overpriced and unreliable renewable energy sources (because that’s what the grifters who line the public servants’ pockets with PAC kickbacks tell them to do), experts in the energy industry see the growing demand for fossil fuels. What happens when demand increases while supply and infrastructure for that supply decreases? What happens when the subsidies being given out (like candy) for renewable energy projects go away? ***

***NYMEX**** – Today is the 4th straight day where we’re seeing NYMEX in the green. Today’s opening price = $3.02, high = $3.07, low = $2.97, currently sitting @ $3.04. Nov ’23 is up as much as $0.06 so far today. NYMEX prices are flat from 1 week ago and down approximately $1.35 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2023 Balance = $3.19, 2024 = $3.45, 2025 = $4.04. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Moving to Dec ’23 since Nov ’23 is off the board as of tomorrow Starting @ $3.43/$3.50. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $3.35/3.27. *

***PRODUCTION & DEMAND**** – Production – Down to 100.5Bcf/D. Supply as of 10-26-23 = 107Bcf. Last week = 101.3Bcf/D. Next week’s estimate = 102.4Bcf/D. Last year = 102.2Bcf/D. 3 yr. avg. = 97.2Bcf/D.*

* Demand – 7-day average = 96.5BCf. Expected to increase from 97Bcf last week to 104Bcf next week. Colder temperatures in the northern Plains and Mid-Con.*

***RIG COUNT ****– The natural gas rig count has declined 24% since the beginning of 2023. Oil rigs are also down, especially in the Permian. 18% of all the natural gas in the US comes from oil producing rigs in the Permian. So, if crude prices fall, oil rigs shut in, and so does the natural gas in those rigs. Oil stockpiles increased by 1.4MM barrels last week, sitting just 5% below the 5-year average. So, this is a good thing for natural gas production. Next rig count is 10-27-23. Last week’s rig count = + 1 for oil with a total of 502 active oil rigs. Last week’s natural gas rig count = + 1 for a total of 118 active natural gas rigs. That’s two consecutive weeks with an overall increased rig count.*

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis is down for both PG&E and SoCal for both short and long term. Increased capacity and storage injections into Aliso Canyon should, at the very least, limit a winter bull run. At best, a strong downward correction. *

***LNG**** – Exports = 14.3Bcf/D. *

***WEATHER**** – Temperatures fall below 20 degrees in the Dakotas. The rest of the U.S. enjoying temps in the 70’s and 80’s today. The 6–10-day forecast shows below normal temps moving through the Mid-Con to the lower Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The 10 – 15 forecast shows above normal temperatures for the West with the remainder of the U.S. near normal.*

***STORAGE**** – End of season storage estimates = 3.8Tcf. Today’s storage report estimated an injection of 81Bcf. The actual report shows an injection of only 74Bcf. We are now 313Bcf higher than this time last year, and 183Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,517Bcf. At 3,700Bcf, total working gas remains within the 5-year historical range.*
