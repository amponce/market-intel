***THE One Minute Energy Update for 1/30/24***

***\#NYMEXNearing$2.00 #PG&EBasisFalling #SoCalGasBasisFalling #WeatherBearish #DemandDown #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– March is now the prompt month. Driving factors continue to be bearish for the next week. Nearing the $2.00 mark now that March is prompt. *

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****Open = $2.06, High = $2.09, Low = $2.04, Current = $2.07. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.40 from 1 week ago and down approximately $1.00 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.54, 2025 = $3.42, 2026 = $3.74. *

*We are below the 50-day ($2.68), the 20-day ($2.70), and the 9-day ($2.50) average. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $25/$2.35. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $2.10*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.10/$1.98. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Production = 102Bcf/D. Today’s Est. Supply = 111.8Bcf. Supply 7-Day Avg. = 109.65Bcf. There is a growing number of people in the industry becoming more and more bullish for the second half of 2024 and 2025. Supply not being as stockpiled, for these periods, as they would like it to be is their main concern. That makes sense. We’ve had a soft winter so far. A normal to above normal summer paired with a normal or below normal winter, and NYMEX could be right back up to where it was in 2022 and 2021. *

*Demand 7-day Avg. = 120.07Bcf. Demand is still expected to fall below the seasonal average this week. *

***BASIS**** – Both PG&E CG and SoCal Basis are moving up and down, depending on which month you’re looking at. Both PG&E and SoCal basis points have room to fall, in my opinion. The only driving factor that could keep Basis prices elevated is fear of being short. And in California, fear is a strong driving factor. Logic is limited. *

*The PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. The SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. The SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

***EXPORTS & LNG EXPORTS**** – The President and CEO of the American Gas Association, Karen Harbert, recently stated that our current administration’s decision to pause approvals on LNG permits (to appease climate activists) will have some very bad effects on the US, such as stunting economic growth, pushing allies our towards adversaries, and giving these adversaries more power around the world.

***CRUDE – ****Prices are falling due to the strength of the US dollar and slower than expected OPEC cuts. *

***RIG COUNT – ****The latest rig count comes in at 621 total rigs. Oil rigs rose by 2 for a total of 499 rigs. Natural gas rigs fell by 1 for a total of 119 rigs. The overall rig count is 19% below this time last year. *

***WEATHER**** – Storm Watch in full effect for Pac NW. C California bracing for severe rain and wind by tomorrow. Storms rolling through the Carolinas. Other than that, it is warmer than normal throughout the US. 6 – 10-day forecast = less bullish. 10-15-day forecast = less bullish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – We are now 110Bcf above last year at this time and 142Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,714Bcf for this time of year. At 2,856Bcf, working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. *

***RENEWABLE ENERGY**** – Straight from the US Energy Information Administration – using natural gas for power generation is doing a better job at reducing emissions than adding renewable energy. This pushes my point further that the smart renewable is nuclear. If we truly want to lower emissions, the answer is not wind and solar.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****NYMEX is cheap. We’re waiting on CA Basis. Tomorrow through next week, let’s talk and lock up NYMEX. *
