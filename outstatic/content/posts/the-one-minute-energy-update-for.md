***THE One Minute Energy Update for 1/29/24***

***\#NYMEXDown #PG&EBasisFalling #SoCalGasBasisFalling #WeatherIsActive #DemandDown #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– Last day for Feb as prompt month. NYMEX is down as much as $0.25 from today’s opening bell and after Friday’s late rally. Driving factors continue to be bearish for the next week. Could we see $2.00 NYMEX by week’s end?*

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****Open = $2.68, High = $2.76, Low = $2.46, Current = $2.47. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.05 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.50 from 1 year ago. *

*We are below the 50-day ($2.70), the 20-day ($2.79), and the 9-day ($2.60) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.66, 2025 = $3.52, 2026 = $3.79. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.86/$3.02. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $2.64*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.48/$2.26. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Production is steady at just over 102Bcf/D since setting a record of 105.5Bcf/D last week. Today’s Est. Supply = 108.2Bcf. Supply 7-Day Avg. = 107.8Bcf. *

*Demand is expected to fall below the seasonal average this week. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E CG and SoCal Basis could see more than normal movement this week simply due to the storms coming in later this week. Waiting for today’s Basis market to land after early trading movement. *

*The PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. The SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. The SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

***EXPORTS & LNG EXPORTS**** – Freeport LNG terminal in Texas reported last week that the most recent winter storm knocked out one of their three trains. This should cut into domestic feed gas demand. *

***CRUDE – ****Due to inventory numbers falling dramatically, look for domestic crude to rally in price while they work to increase inventories.*

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – CAISO sitting just above $48. *

***RIG COUNT – ****The latest rig count comes in at 621 total rigs. Oil rigs rose by 2 for a total of 499 rigs. Natural gas rigs fell by 1 for a total of 119 rigs. The overall rig count is 19% below this time last year. *

***WEATHER**** – Warmer temperatures for most of the US. The Pac NW and Ohio Valley will get slammed with rain over the next day or so. 6 – 10-day forecast = turning bullish. 10-15-day forecast = turning bullish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – We are now 110Bcf above last year at this time and 142Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,714Bcf for this time of year. At 2,856Bcf, working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. *

***RENEWABLE ENERGY**** – Global Energy Monitor shows China has plans to build 655 new coal plants. Why, you ask? It takes that level of energy to build windmills and solar panels. Are you clued in yet on this money play? Nuclear is great and we, the US, have more MW capacity than any other country last I checked. And it’s still less than 20% of our overall energy source to meet power demand in the US. Like it or not, we need fossil fuels, especially natural gas.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****NYMEX could fall to the lowest prices we have seen in a few years. Look to lock in NYMEX separately if we plan to execute fixed prices this week. PG&E CG Basis and SoCal Basis may bounce around this week – may not be the best time to lock this week. The market changes constantly which means the strategy has to be adjusted constantly to take advantage of the current market and just as importantly, if not more importantly, minimize the market risk. *
