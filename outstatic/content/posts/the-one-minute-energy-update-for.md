***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 11/30/23***

***\#NYMEXFlatteningForNow #PG&EBasisDown #SoCalGasBasisFallsFurther #CABasisCouldTank #Energy #WeatherMainFactor #LNGSteady #NaturalGasProcurement #CalforniaPowerRateHikes***

***NYMEX**** – Today’s opening price for Jan ‘24 = $2.79, high = $2.85, low = $2.76, currently sitting @ $2.77. NYMEX prices are down $0.12 from 1 week ago and down approximately $4.45 from 1 year ago. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.*

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2023 Balance = $2.86, 2024 = $3.08, 2025 = $3.90. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.88/$2.98.*

***SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $2.73/$2.66. *

**PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND** *– Production = 104.2Bcf. Supply averaging 110.4Bcf/D for the past 7 days. Daily production for Winter 2023/2024 is expected to average 101.7Bcf/D. Demand is expected to fall to 118Bcf today. Demand averaged 127Bcf/D over the past 7 days, topping out at 140.3Bcf yesterday.*

***RIG COUNT ****– The oil & gas rig count (11-22-23) increased for the second straight week. Oil rigs saw no change from the previous week, for a total of 500 active oil rigs. Natural gas rigs increased by 3 for a total of 117 active natural gas rigs.*

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis trickles down further. SoCal Basis continues to fall in chunks. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – terminals are looking into building carbon capturing facilities to be saved and used in other products and projects. Pretty smart. Now if they can find a way to burn less fuel transporting around the world, we got a real winner. *

***WEATHER**** – Most of the U.S. is colder today with a lot of rain from Seattle all the way across the U.S. Sunny in Boston – must be Shane MacGowan smiling down on the city with such Irish pride. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows way above from the Pac NW through the Mid-Con, near normal east of Toledo. The 10-15-day forecast shows above normal for the entire U.S. except for New England, Florida, and Seattle. *

***STORAGE**** – Today’s storage report estimated a withdrawal of 10Bcf. The actual report shows a 10Bcf injection. The “experts” making the predictions every week must be some of the most dilettante people around or deliberately doing so to manipulate the market. We are now 341Bcf higher than this time last year, and 303Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,533Bcf. At 3,836Bcf, total working gas remains within the 5-year historical range.*

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – Right around the same time as you get your holiday season credit card bill in 2024, the great people of PG&E, SoCalEdison, SDG&E, and every other electricity LDC in CA will be jacking up your residential electric rates by around 22%. Someone must endure the cost of solar panels taking those homes off the LDC grid (revenue stream), and that someone is you, the LDC rate payer! NEVER underestimate the LDCs ability to screw you to the wall. And don’t forget to do your part by sitting in the dark between 4PM and 9PM!*
