***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 12/28/23***

***\#NYMEXNewPromptMonth #PG&ECGBasisUp #SoCalGasBasisUp #StorageEstimateWrongAgain #WeatherBullish #NaturalGasDemandBelowNormal #LNGExports #CarbonOffsets***

***NYMEX ****– Prices are up $0.11 so far today but with a new prompt month position. Most months are well below the NYMEX yearly average for the past 3 years. And we’re beating the next 3 years of projected averages (see below). What more could you ask for??*

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.86), are dead even with the 20-day ($2.54) and above the 9-day ($2.52) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.62, 2025 = $3.44, 2026 = $3.76. *

***2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.***

***Today’s opening price for Feb ‘24**** = $2.45, high = $2.56, low = $2.41, currently sitting @ $2.55. NYMEX prices are up approximately $0.30 from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.50 from 1 year ago. *

***BASIS**** – Both PG&E Basis SoCal CG Basis are up considerably today from yesterday. It could be nothing more than an upward correction from the collapse we enjoyed yesterday. Driving factors remain more bearish than bullish. Prices are still far better than what we have seen over the past 12 months. Let’s plan on locking up Basis next week – either in strips or individual months. *

***PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. ***

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.70/$2.79. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.54/$2.47. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Natural gas output rose to 108.7Bcf/D so far in December from the 108.3/D record setting in November. This level of supply is expected to meet the needs for Jan ’24, even in a cold Jan ’24, making weather less important of a driving factor going into Feb ’24. *

***WEATHER**** – Cooler temperatures with lots of rain around the U.S today. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows above normal for the Pac NW and northern border, near normal from California across to Virginia, then below normal temperatures for the lower third of the U.S. The 10-15-day forecast calls for above normal temperatures in the Great Lakes region, near normal for the Pac NW and Northeast, and below normal for the rest of the U.S. *

***STORAGE**** – This week’s storage forecast was a withdrawal of 78Bcf. The actual report came in with a withdrawal of 87Bcf. I wonder if the same people giving such inaccurate estimates are also taking financial positions. Who could be this wrong, this often, and still be asked to forecast? Getting back on track...This puts storage 348Bcf above last year at this time and 316Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,174Bcf. At 3,490Bcf, we remain well within the 5-year historical range. *

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – CAISO sitting just above $48. That’s $6 cheaper than just a week ago.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. mandates are coming. So, best to get on board before they force you onboard. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*
