***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 12/18/23***

***\#NYMEXUp #PG&ECGBasisUp #SoCalGasBasisUp #Energy #HereComesTheRainAgain #NaturalGasDemandDown #LNGExports #SolarStillSucks #CarbonOffsets***

*NYMEX – Up this morning, as much as a dime. Demand could fall as power outages are reported along the east coast due to storms with hurricane level winds. It’s the middle of December so we can expect bullish movement. Demand is soft for this time of year. Weather forecasts support bears. Production remains strong. And Solar is expected to increase by 40% in 2024, bringing that lagging joke of an energy source up to almost 4% contribution to the overall power generation. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.96) and 20-day ($2.65) averages, and above the 9-day ($2.50) average. *

*Today’s opening price for Jan ‘24 = $2.50, high = $2.59, low = $2.48, currently sitting @ $2.58. NYMEX prices are up approximately $0.01 from 1 week ago and down approximately $4.37 from 1 year ago. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.*

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.68, 2025 = $3.51, 2026 = $3.81. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.56/$2.63. We hit the first level earlier this morning and remain above so far today.*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.39/$2.30. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 110.0Bcf/D. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 109.8Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 104.9Bcf/D. Daily production for Winter 2023/2024 is expected to average 101.7Bcf/D. *

*Demand = 122.9Bcf. *

***RIG COUNT – ****As of 12-15-23 – Overall rig**** ****count = 623. Oil fell by 2 rigs to 503, gas went unchanged for a total of 119 rigs, and miscellaneous rigs fell by 1. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis is up a dime as is SoCal Basis. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Latest average (12-15-23) = 14.6Bcf/D. *

***WEATHER**** – Temperatures remain above normal for most of the U.S. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows above normal for the U.S., especially in the Mid-Con. Only areas forecasted not to be above/well above normal are SoCal and AZ. The 10-15-day forecast calls for above normal temperatures across the U.S. except for AZ, south Texas, and FL.*

***STORAGE**** – Last week’s report has us at 245Bcf higher than this time last year, and 260Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,404Bcf. At 3,664Bcf, total working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. And for those of you here in the Tarnished State of California, our state government will be mandating that you do so soon enough. So, best to get on board before they force you onboard. To give you an idea, looking at today’s menu, we have Indonesia Hydro projects going for $0.50/tonne (always measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, or CO2e) to Honduras Cookstove projects going for $12.00/tonne. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*
