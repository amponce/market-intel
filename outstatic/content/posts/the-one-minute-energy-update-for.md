***THE One Minute Energy Update for 1/26/24***

***\#NYMEXDownAgain #PG&ECGBasisFalling #SoCalGasBasisFalling #WeatherNotDoneYet #DemandDown #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets #RenewablesStillLacking***

***NYMEX ****– NYMEX is down another $0.10+ so far this morning. Driving factors remain bearish for the next week. *

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****Open = $2.60, High = $2.67, Low = $2.42, Current = $2.45. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.25 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.60 from 1 year ago. *

*We are below the 50-day ($2.71), the 20-day ($2.79), and the 9-day ($2.62) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.64, 2025 = $3.50, 2026 = $3.77. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.79/$3.01. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $2.66*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.43/$2.30. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – The US hit a new daily production record on 1-24-24, producing 105.5Bcf in one day. Today’s Est. Supply = 109.4Bcf. Supply 7-Day Avg. = 109.8Bcf. *

*Demand 7-Day Avg. = 146.1Bcf. Yesterday’s Demand = 117.4Bcf. Demand is now tapering off from earlier in the week. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E CG falls a few cents more. SoCal CG is down a few cents. There should be more room for both PG&E and SoCal Basis to fall. *

*The PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. The SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. The SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

***EXPORTS & LNG EXPORTS**** – The Biden administration is stalling on approving new LNG projects. The current administration said they will increase their evaluation process regarding proposed LNG projects and the impact they have on climate crisis. Projects already in place for completion before 2027 shouldn’t be impacted so the immediate market should be impacted either. It could, however, push buyers looking to lock in long term contracts (as most of them are long term) to enter contracts with other LNG nations, hurting the newfound US dominance in this market. They’re also hitting pause on this because the pushers of unreliable energy (we know who they are) swear that their products will be ready to go by then. We shall see. One thing for sure – LNG just became far more political.*

***RIG COUNT – ****The next rig count comes out later today. *

***WEATHER**** – A lot of the US will warm up substantially over the next few days. *

*6 – 10-day forecast = bearish. 10-15-day forecast = even money. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – We are now 110Bcf above last year at this time and 142Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,714Bcf for this time of year. At 2,856Bcf, working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. *

***RENEWABLE ENERGY**** – The American Gas Association reported this fact earlier in the week, “The U.S. saw a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, largely driven by the increased use of natural gas.” That’s good to hear, especially when we look at the energy sources used to meet demand during the most recent winter weather; natural gas 62%, petroleum, 13%, coal 10%, nuclear 7%, wind 4%, hydro 2%, and solar with 1% contribution. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****NYMEX, PG&E CG Basis, and SoCal Basis all have room to fall further early next week. *
