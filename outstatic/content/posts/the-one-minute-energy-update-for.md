***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 11/27/23***

***\#NYMEXDownFurtherl #PG&EBasisDownBIG #SoCalGasBasisDownBIG #Energy #Weather #LNG #NaturalGasProcurement ***

*Roughly 2Bcf was pulled offline over the weekend while a gas leak near McCamey, TX is assessed and repaired. The situation is currently day to day. This proves even further that weather is the main driving factor right now for both NYMEX and Basis pricing. If the weather charts hold their current forecast, we could see further discounted pricing. Downward pressure on 2024. 2025 is still too far out to experience downward pressure from current driving factors. The current driving factors lean towards buying 2024 fixed prices over the next 5 – 10 business days.*
