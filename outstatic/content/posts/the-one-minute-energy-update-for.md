***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 12/6/23***

***\#NYMEXDownAgain #PG&EBasisDown #SoCalGasBasisDown #WeatherWarming #StorageReportLooming #NaturalGasProcurement ***

*NYMEX – The “experts” believe yesterday’s slight increase in price signals a potential short-term bottom. Well....that was indeed a very short term. We could see bulls return tomorrow if the storage reports guesstimate hits. Hit or miss, I believe the bull run will be short lived. We remain well below the 50-day ($3.06), 20-day ($2.90), and 9-day ($2.76) averages. *

*Today’s opening price for Jan ‘24 = $2.69, high = $2.75, low = $2.68, currently sitting @ $2.68. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.05 from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.85 from 1 year ago. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.*

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.89, 2025 = $3.75, 2026 = $3.95. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.77/$2.83.*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.66/$2.61. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Continues to set records. As of 12-5-23, production = 105.5Bcf. Supply averaging 109.8Bcf/D for the past 7 days. Daily production for Winter 2023/2024 is expected to average 101.7Bcf/D. I believe that is a low estimate. Demand averaged 120Bcf/D over the past 7 days. Today’s expected demand = 109.1Bcf.*

***RIG COUNT - ****The oil rig count (as of 12-1-23) increased by 5 rigs for a total of 505, the highest since Sep ’23. The gas rig count fell by 1 rig for a total of 116 active gas rigs. We are 20% below where we were this time last year. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis down a penny or two. SoCal Basis is also down a few cents. We currently have strong storage, favorable weather patterns, and limited capacity constraints. All bearish driving factors.*

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Latest average = 14.6Bcf/D. Nov ’23 averaged 14.3Bcf/D, up 0.06Bcf/D from Oct ‘23’s average of 13.7Bcf/D. *

***WEATHER**** – Warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows above normal for SoCal, North Dakota, and New England. Texas and the Gulf States are below normal. The rest of the U.S., near normal. The 10-15-day forecast shows near normal for the southern region of the U.S., normal to above normal for the rest of the U.S. *

***STORAGE**** – We are now 341Bcf higher than this time last year, and 303Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,533Bcf. At 3,836Bcf, total working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. Next storage report comes out tomorrow. The guesstimate for tomorrow’s report is a withdrawal of 105Bcf. Compare that to 30Bcf last year and the 5-year average of 48Bcf. If that guesstimate hits, that could be the bull long position traders have been praying for. It will take more than one ridiculous withdrawal to keep the bulls running for an extended period.*

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – CAISO sitting just above $68.*
