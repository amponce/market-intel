***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 12/19/23***

***\#NYMEXDown #PG&ECGBasisFlat #SoCalGasBasiDownSlightly #WeatherBearish #NaturalGasDemand #LNGExports #CarbonOffsets***

*NYMEX – After a 3-day bull run (less than $0.20 on the front month…) and traders running around like it was July in Pamplona, NYMEX turned bearish once again, and for good reason even with demand being stronger than expected. Weather forecasts continue to support bears. Production remains strong. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.94), the 20-day ($2.63), and the 9-day ($2.51) averages. *

*Today’s opening price for Jan ‘24 = $2.51, high = $2.53, low = $2.41, currently sitting @ $2.42. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.05 from 1 week ago and down approximately $4.20 from 1 year ago. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.*

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.67, 2025 = $3.49, 2026 = $3.82. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.57/$2.63. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.46/$2.42. Both levels have already been hit this morning.*

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 109.1Bcf/D. Supply 7 Day Avg. = still 109.8Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 105.2Bcf/D. Daily production for Winter 2023/2024(which starts 12-21-23) is expected to average 101.7Bcf/D. *

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 122.6Bcf. *

***RIG COUNT – ****As of 12-15-23 – Overall rig**** ****count = 623. Oil fell by 2 rigs to 503, gas went unchanged for a total of 119 rigs, and miscellaneous rigs fell by 1. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis is relatively flat from yesterday. SoCal Basis is down a few cents from yesterday. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Latest average (12-18-23) = 14.6Bcf/D. *

***WEATHER**** – Warming in the parts that need it, cooling in the parts that want it. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows above normal for most of the U.S except for SoCal/AZ/NM. Also calling for above normal precipitation, especially in the Mid-Con. The 10-15-day forecast calls for above normal temperatures for most of the U.S. except for the most southern regions that will gladly take near normal temperatures. Above normal precipitation for both coasts. *

***STORAGE**** – Last week’s report has us at 245Bcf higher than this time last year, and 260Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,404Bcf. At 3,664Bcf, total working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. And for those of you here in the Tarnished State of California, our state government will be mandating that you do so soon enough. So, best to get on board before they force you onboard. To give you an idea, looking at today’s menu, we have Indonesia Hydro projects going for $0.50/tonne (always measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, or CO2e) to Honduras Cookstove projects going for $12.00/tonne. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*
