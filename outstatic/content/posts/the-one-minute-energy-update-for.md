***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/5/24***

***\#ReturnOfTheBottomLine #NYMEXDown #PG&ECGBasisUp #SoCalGasBasisUp #WeatherStillBullish #ProductionUp #DemandIncreasing #StorageStrong #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– The recent bull run seems to be taking today off. Weather systems should push the bulls again next week, but it should be short lived. All other driving factors remain bearish. *

***Today’s opening NYMEX price for Feb ‘24**** = $2.84, high = $2.84, low = $2.68, currently sitting @ $2.75. NYMEX prices are up approximately $0.20 from 1 week ago and down approximately $1.40 from 1 year ago. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.83) and are above the 20-day ($2.54) and the 9-day ($2.62) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.86, 2025 = $3.59, 2026 = $3.85. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. *

*2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.89/$2.97. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.71/$2.60. *

***BASIS**** – In case you missed this, we’ll keep this up through this week - We expect Demand to increase this Spring and Summer in the SW region. An increase in demand in the SW will most likely drive Basis prices up throughout California. The reason(s) for this – increased demand with numerous new facilities coming online in the SW region, increasing natural gas demand, as well as higher than normal temperatures being forecasted (at this time) for both seasons. *

*Both PG&E Basis and SoCal CG Basis look to be closing this week out higher than where they both started. It is my opinion that this rally will be short lived because all driving factors other than weather continue to be bearish. *

*PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. *

*SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. *

*SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

*Current fixed price offers for 2024 – 2026 are all lower than the 2023 Index prices. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 109.7Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 109.45Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 105.7Bcf/D. Demand expected to be moderate over the next 7 days.*

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 126.48Bcf. Today’s expected demand = 135.3Bcf.*

***RIG COUNT – ****The first rig count of 2024 will be released later today at/after 10AM, PST. ****End of year rig count = ****622, down 20.15% from 1 year ago. Oil rose by 2 rigs to 500 while natural gas rigs count closed the year at 120 rigs, and miscellaneous rigs finished 2023 with 2. *

***WEATHER**** – Continued cooler temperatures throughout the U.S. today. Some snow is expected to fall in the MW later today. Bullish 6 – 10-day forecast. Bullish 10-15-day forecast. Bearish 3-month forecast. Bullish Summer forecast.*

***STORAGE**** – We are now 553Bcf higher than we were last year and 399Bcf above the 5-year average 3,077Bcf. At 3,476Bcf, we are above the 5-year historical range.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****The first sign of real winter for some of the U.S. came rolling in today and NYMEX prices….are falling. Yesterday prices rallied after a much smaller than anticipated storage report was released. So, for the time being, let’s take a pause and let the amateurs play. We’ll come back to this when the downward correction takes place, in 7 – 15 days. *****
