***\#NYMEX #NYMEXDrops12%In3Days #PG&EBasisFallsHard #SoCalBasisFallsHard ***

***\#WeatherIsOurFriend #StrongGasProduction #FallingDemand***

***NYMEX**** – Monday saw a 7% drop due to record production and mild weather forecasts. Yesterday and today see an additional 5% drop. Today’s opening price for Dec ‘23 = $3.17, high = $3.18, low = $3.07, currently sitting @ $3.09. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.25 from 1 week ago and down approximately $3.35 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2023 Balance = $3.14, 2024 = $3.43, 2025 = $4.12. *

***RESISTANCE**** –Starting @ $3.25/$3.37. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $3.06/$2.98. *

***PRODUCTION & DEMAND**** – Production - Monday set a record high of 104.4Bcf/D. Yesterday hit 103.9Bcf/D, still up 3.3Bcf on the 2023 average. Daily supply so far in Nov ‘23 is averaging 107.3Bcf with an all-time high of 108.0Bcf this past Saturday. *

*Demand - Heating demand for this time of year is down from last year, the 10-year average, and the 30-year average. We averaged 110Bc/D demand last week. This week we may barely hit 100Bcf/D demand.*

***RIG COUNT ****– Next rig count will be released 11-10-23. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis is down as much as $0.50 on the prompt month and $0.10 to $0.20 on the following months. SoCal Basis is also down as much as $0.05 for Dec ’23 and down anywhere between $0.10 - $0.30 on the early 2024 months. *

***FIRST of the MONTH INDEX PRICING (approximately) ****\- Nov ’23 PG&E CG First of the Month Index = $6.83. 2023 PG&E First of the Month Index Average through Nov ‘23 = $10.15. Nov ’23 SoCal CG First of the Month Index = $8.05. 2023 SoCal CG First of the Month Index Average through Nov ’23 = $11.36. SoCal Border Nov ’23 First of the Month Index = $$4.99. Basis continues to fall. 2023 SoCal CG First of the Month Index Average through Nov ’23 = $8.40.*

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Expected to fall from last year’s averages this winter as Europe’s stockpiles continue to grow, lessening the fear of meeting winter demand. Exports reached 13.9Bc/D in Oct ’23. *

***WEATHER**** – A cold front blowing down from the Pac NW seems to be having little effect so far on pricing. The rest of the U.S. continue to enjoy above normal temperatures. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows near normal for both coasts with the rest of the U.S. above to well above normal. The 10-15-day forecast continues to show near normal for the West, below normal for SoCal, and well above normal for the rest of the U.S.*

***STORAGE**** – Could the lack of a storage report coming out this week be adding to the downward price pressure we’re enjoying this week?? It’s possible. *

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – averaging under $59MWH. *
