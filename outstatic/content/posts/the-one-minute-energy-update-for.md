***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 11/14/23***

***\#NYMEX #PG&E #SoCalGas #Energy #Weather #RigCount #LNG #NaturalGasProcurement ***

***NYMEX**** – NYMEX surged 5% yesterday but that bull run has stalled for the moment. Today’s opening price for Dec ‘23 = $3.23, high = $3.27, low = $3.13, currently sitting @ $3.17. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.08 from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.65 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2023 Balance = $3.19, 2024 = $3.38, 2025 = $4.10. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $3.27/$3.35. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $3.16/$3.09. *

***PRODUCTION & DEMAND**** – production is expected to average 105.Bcf/D for the second half of 2023, up 2Bcf from the first half of 2023. That will be some strong production for the balance of 2023. And we’re going to need it. Don’t expect some massive bear run to take place. The numbers below in “Demand” will explain why.*

*Production = 104.4Bcf/D. Overall supply = 110.7Bcf/D. *

*Demand = 110.5Bcf/D. Natural gas is the primary energy source for electricity at 74%, followed by coal at 20%, nuclear at 4%, and renewables at 2%. *

***RIG COUNT ****– The oil & gas rig count fell by 2 last week. - 2 for oil for a total of 494 active oil rigs – compared to 622 active rigs this time last year. Last week’s natural gas rig count is unchanged at 118 active natural gas rigs – compared to 155 active rigs this time last year.*

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis is down a few pennies so far today. SoCal Basis falls further. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – The “experts” expect LNG exports to double by 2027, averaging over 26Bcf/D. That’s a lot of natgas that won’t be coming to the C&I sector where the growing need continues. *

***WEATHER**** – Slightly cooler temperatures for the Pac NW, pleasant throughout the rest of the U.S. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows above normal for the West, below normal for the Pac NW, near normal for the SW, and above normal for the rest of the U.S. The 10-15-day forecast has below normal for the Pac NW, the Plains, western Mid-Con, and slightly above normal for the rest of the U.S.*

***STORAGE**** – The next storage report will be released by EIA 11-16-23.*
