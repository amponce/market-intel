***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 12/4/23***

***Demand rallied over the weekend and is expected to stay up for a few more days. So, with that in mind, NYMEX and Basis fell even further, hitting 52-week lows for NYMEX. All those traders with long positions are looking for ANYTHING to stop this current bear run. And when they do find something, they will make the most of it….when they find it.***
