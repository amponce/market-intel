***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/2/24***

***Happy New Year Everyone! May it be your best year yet! NYMEX is up due to the weather. This morning’s NYMEX rally should be short lived as we are already in January with no forecasts of extended winter conditions at this time. For NYMEX, maybe we wait a bit. CA Basis remains down and down considerably compared to where we were as recently as 4 weeks ago. The best plan right now may be to buy NYMEX and Basis separately and don’t forget that you can buy Basis and NYMEX separately, should you wish to do so, capturing even more of this bear market. ***

***NYMEX ****– Prices are up today and it’s all because of the weather. We’re still beating the NYMEX yearly average for the past 3 years. And we’re still below the next 3 years of projected averages. *

***Today’s opening NYMEX price for Feb ‘24**** = $2.60, high = $2.67, low = $2.51, currently sitting @ $2.59. NYMEX prices are up $0.10 from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.05 from 1 year ago. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.85) and are above the 20-day ($2.52) and the 9-day ($2.55) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.67, 2025 = $3.49, 2026 = $3.82. *

***2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.***

***BASIS**** – We expect more demand to take place this Spring and Summer in the SW region. The reason(s) for this – increased demand with numerous new facilities coming online in the SW region, increasing natural gas demand, as well as higher than normal temperatures being forecasted (at this time) for both seasons. We have seen Basis prices tank in the past few weeks. Let’s take advantage of this while we can. Call myself or Ricco Washington directly to get on this now. Today, PG&E Basis and SoCal CG Basis are down ever so slightly. Driving factors remain more bearish than bullish. We should continue to plan on locking up Basis this week and next week. *

***PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. Current fixed price offers for 2024 – 2026 are all lower than the 2023 Index prices. Take advantage of this while you can.***

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.55/$2.59. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.48/$2.44. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Natural gas output averaged just over 108Bcf/D in December. This level of supply is expected to meet the needs for Jan ’24, even in a cold Jan ’24. National demand is expected to remain light for the balance of this week, then increasing to moderate next week.*

***WEATHER**** – Slow moving weather system over the eastern US will continue to bring showers w/highs in the 30s & 40s. The rest of the US will be mild w/highs in the 40s - 70s. Colder weather systems will track into the MW and NE next week w/highs in the 20s - 40s. Bullish 6 – 10-day forecast. Bullish 10-15-day forecast. Bearish 3-month forecast. Bullish Summer forecast.*



***STORAGE**** – We are 348Bcf above last year at this time and 316Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,174Bcf. At 3,490Bcf, we remain well within the 5-year historical range. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*
