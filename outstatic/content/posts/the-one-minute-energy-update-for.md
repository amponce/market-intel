***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 11/20/23***

***\#NYMEXDown #PG&EBasisDown #SoCalGasBasisUp #StorageReport #RigCount #Energy #Weather #LNG #NaturalGasProcurement ***

***NYMEX**** – NYMEX is down nearly 34% so far this year. Weather, Production, and Demand, as we have seen, can move this commodity quickly. Don’t be the WouldaShouldaCoulda clown. *

*Today’s opening price for Dec ‘23 = $2.95, high = $2.95, low = $2.86, currently sitting @ $2.91. NYMEX prices are flat from 1 week ago and down approximately $3.40 from 1 year ago. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.*

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2023 Balance = $2.96, 2024 = $3.18, 2025 = $4.02. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $3.08/$3.20. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $2.86/$2.76. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Production – varying reports = 103.8Bcf to 105.3Bcf. Compare this to 100.4bcf/D this time last year. Supply sitting at 111.1Bcf/D. *

*Demand averaging 111Bcf/D. ****Fun Fact – highest daily demand for natgas was 12-24-22 at a whopping 157.3Bcf.***

***RIG COUNT ****– The oil & gas rig count increased for the first time in 3 weeks. Oil rigs increase3d by 6 for oil for a total of 500 active oil rigs. Natural gas rigs fell by 4 for a total of 114 active natural gas rigs – lowest for natural gas rig count since early Sep ’23. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis down approximately $0.05 so far today. SoCal Basis is up approximately $0.50. As we have seen, California Basis moves up and down constantly. The best strategy remains – pick a price and pull the trigger when it hits, and don’t second guess yourself. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Averaged 11.6Bcf/D for the first half of 2023. Looks like it will average over 13Bcf/D for the second half of 2023. The U.S. has been the leading LNG exporting country since 2016. Latest reports show 14.2Bcf/D. *

***WEATHER**** – Most of the U.S. will enjoy some chilly temps in the 40’s/50’s. California in the 60’s/70’s, as are the Gulf states. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows near normal for the coasts and below normal for the rest of the U.S. The 10-15-day forecast shows near normal for the West coast, near normal for the Rockies and to the north, and below normal for the rest of the U.S. The latest 3 month forecast for Dec-Feb is showing above normal for the northern half, near normal for the southern half. And since we’re looking out past the next 4 weeks, next spring/summer is forecasted to be normal to above normal. That forecast will give strength to those NYMEX months. Same for Basis here in the West. *

***STORAGE**** – The next storage report comes out this Wednesday. We are now 198Bcf higher than this time last year, and 203Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,630Bcf. At 3,833Bcf, total working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. We’re 5% above both last year and the 5-year average.*
