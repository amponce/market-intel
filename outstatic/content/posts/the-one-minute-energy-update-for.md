***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 12/5/23***

***\#NYMEXUp #PG&EBasisDownHard #SoCalGasBasisDownHard #Energy #WeatherInevitable #LNGSteady #NaturalGasProcurement ***

***NYMEX**** – ****NYMEX is up today but still below the 50-day ($3.06), 20-day ($2.92), and 9-day ($2.79) averages. ***

*Today’s opening price for Jan ‘24 = $2.69, high = $2.78, low = $2.67, currently sitting @ $2.74. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.03 from 1 week ago and down approximately $3.50 from 1 year ago. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.*

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.88, 2025 = $3.76, 2026 = $3.95. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.74/$2.80.*

***SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $2.69/$2.64. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** - Production = 105.5Bcf. Supply averaging 109.8Bcf/D for the past 7 days. Daily production for Winter 2023/2024 is expected to average 101.7Bcf/D. I’ll take the over on that bet. Demand averaged 120Bcf/D over the past 7 days. Today’s expected demand = 109.1Bcf.*

***RIG COUNT - ****The oil rig count (as of 12-1-23) increased by 5 rigs for a total of 505, the highest since Sep ’23. The gas rig count fell by 1 rig for a total of 116 active gas rigs. We are 20% below where we were this time last year. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis falls further. SoCal Basis falls further. We’re seeing a lot more individual months fall into the $2 and $1, down from the $3 range. We’re still well above the historical ranges ($0.55 to $0.75 for PG&E CG, $0.00 to $0.50 at SoCal CG, and flat to negative for SoCal Border). We may never get back to the historical ranges, especially since CA power generation becomes more and more reliant on natural gas. But we are coming down significantly from the highs endured over the past few years. And as quickly as they fall, as quickly they can go back up. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Latest average = 14.6Bcf/D. Nov ’23 averaged 14.3Bcf/D, up 0.06Bcf/D from Oct ‘23’s average of 13.7Bcf/D. *

***WEATHER**** – Warmer temperatures for most of the U.S. while the Great Lakes and New England regions experience colder temperatures from yesterday. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows above normal for the Pac NW, West, Rockies, and Plains, Northeast, and New England. Near normal for the rest. The 10-15-day forecast shows above normal for everyone except for the Southeast and the Carolinas where it will be near normal. *

***STORAGE**** – We are now 341Bcf higher than this time last year, and 303Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,533Bcf. At 3,836Bcf, total working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. No estimates being spewed just yet for this week's storage report…*

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – CAISO sitting just above $53.*
