***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/3/24***

***\#NYMEXUpAgain #PG&ECGBasisUp #SoCalGasBasisUp #WeatherTurningBullish #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets***

***NYMEX ****– Prices are up today and it’s all because of the weather. We can expect NYMEX to be more bullish than bearish over the next 10 days. Nothing to get too worked up about seeing as this “rally” is approximately 3%. *

***Today’s opening NYMEX price for Feb ‘24**** = $2.57, high = $2.71, low = $2.53, currently sitting @ $2.65. NYMEX prices are up $0.05 from 1 week ago and down approximately $1.85 from 1 year ago. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.84) and are above the 20-day ($2.52) and the 9-day ($2.55) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.73, 2025 = $3.53, 2026 = $3.83. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 average = $3.84. *

***BASIS**** – In case you missed this, we’ll keep this up through this week - We expect more demand to take place this Spring and Summer in the SW region. The reason(s) for this – increased demand with numerous new facilities coming online in the SW region, increasing natural gas demand, as well as higher than normal temperatures being forecasted (at this time) for both seasons. We have seen Basis prices tank in the past few weeks. Let’s take advantage of this while we can. Call myself or Ricco Washington directly to get on this now. *

*PG&E Basis and SoCal CG Basis both rallied yesterday and continue to do so this morning. Capacity and storage both remain strong, so weather appears to be the driving factor behind this rally. *

***PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. Current fixed price offers for 2024 – 2026 are all lower than the 2023 Index prices. Take advantage of this while you can.***

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.65/$2.75. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.50/$2.43. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 109.6Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 109.45Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 105.2Bcf/D. We continue to set daily production records. Daily production for Winter 2023/2024 should come in higher than the expected average of 101.7Bcf. Demand is expected to be moderate over the next 7 days.*

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 126.48Bcf. Today’s expected demand = 133.1Bcf.*

***RIG COUNT – End of year rig count = ****622, down 20.15% from 1 year ago. Oil rose by 2 rigs to 500 while natural gas rigs count closed the year at 120 rigs, and miscellaneous rigs finished 2023 with 2. 2023 showed a drop in rig counts in all 4 quarters. Despite the drop in rigs, natgas production continues to set records. *

***BASIS**** - SoCal Basis is rallying this week but not as much as PG&E CG Basis, which is up as much as $0.50 over the past 2 days for the front months. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – The U.S. knocks Qatar out of the #1 position of world’s largest LNG exporter. LNG exports continue to average around 14Bcf/D. *

***WEATHER**** – Stronger weather systems impacting the MW and East w/rain, snow, and highs of 20s - 40s. The rest of the US will be mild w/highs of mid-40s - 60s. Natural gas demand across the U.S. is expected to be below normal for this time of year as the eastern half of the U.S. will enjoy temperatures well above normal and the western half of the U.S. falls below normal. Bullish 6 – 10-day forecast. Bullish 10-15-day forecast. Bearish 3-month forecast. Bullish Summer forecast.*

***STORAGE**** – Tomorrow’s storage report is forecasted to come in with a 50Bcf withdrawal. Compare that to 97Bcf withdrawal 1 year ago and a 5-year average of 29Bcf for the same time of year. *

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – CAISO sitting just above $43. That’s $5 cheaper than just a week ago.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*
