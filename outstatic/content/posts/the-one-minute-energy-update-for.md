***THE One Minute Energy Update for 1/24/24***

***\#NYMEXUp #PG&ECGBasisFalling #SoCalGasBasisElevated #WeatherLessRelevant #BigStorageWithdrawal #DemandDown #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets #IndicativesReturn***

***NYMEX ****– NYMEX is back down after a 1-day $0.20 rally. The rally appears to be from technical buying, locking in cheap forward positions. Driving factors remain bearish and today’s downturn shows that. *

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****Open = $2.68 High = $2.88, Low = $2.57, Current = $2.62. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.75 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.80 from 1 year ago. *

*We are below the 50-day ($2.73), the 20-day ($2.80), and the 9-day ($2.71) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.71, 2025 = $3.55, 2026 = $3.84. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.72/$2.81. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $2.61*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.52/$2.41. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 108.7Bcf. Supply 7-Day Avg. = 108.8Bcf. Yesterday’s Production =101.3Bcf/D. *

*Demand 7-Day Avg. = 146.1Bcf. Yesterday’s Demand = 121.4Bcf. Demand expected to remain high through 1-28-24.*

***BASIS**** – PG&E CG is up a few cents this morning but overall, the downward movement continues. Strong opportunities for PG&E CG fixed price strips right now. SoCal CG continues to fall but not to the level yet of where it makes sense to lock in longer term strips. We may want to continue to pick off individual months if we must buy something today. Straight strip opportunities should show up soon. If these anticipated opportunities fail to show up, we may be looking at a new pricing plateau for SoCal. We will see. We do, however, continue to beat the past 3 years (listed on the next line).*

*The PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. The SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. The SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

***EXPORTS & LNG EXPORTS**** – There is an expected LNG glut for the remainder of this winter and quite possibly the balance of 2024. *

***RIG COUNT – ****The next rig count comes out tomorrow. *

***WEATHER**** – Weather is warming. *

*6 – 10-day forecast = bearish. 10-15-day forecast = bearish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – The estimate was a 324Bcf withdrawal. Today’s Storage Report shows a withdrawal of 326Bcf. That is a whomping withdrawal that moves our 1 year and 5-year surpluses from 300+ down to 100+. The NYMEX reacts to this news by further downward movement. We’re now 110Bcf above this time last year and 142Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,714Bcf for this time of year. At 2,856Bcf, working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****NYMEX and PG&E CG Basis are both good buys right now – below the past 3 years and below the forward 3 years. We need to wait on SoCal Basis as it is more expensive right now than it was the first week of 2024. It’s a good buy but I believe it can be better.*
