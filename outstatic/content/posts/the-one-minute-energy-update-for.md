***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/18/24***

***\#NYMEXFallsFurther #PG&ECGBasisFalling #SoCalGasBasisFalling #WeatherBackOnStrong #DemandHigh #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– The Prompt month dropped over $0.40 yesterday. We’re down another $0.10 today. As quickly as it ran up, it ran down even quicker. Don’t be foolish enough to think it won’t or can’t happen again. This commodity will continue to be volatile, which is why it is imperative that we take advantage of down markets.*

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****open = $2.87, high = $2.96, low = $2.72, currently @ $2.74. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.55 from 1 week ago and down approximately $1.10 from 1 year ago. *

*We are below the 50-day ($2.789), the 20-day ($2.81), and the 9-day ($3.04) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.84, 2025 = $3.58, 2026 = $3.84. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.96/$3.06. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $2.96*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.76/$2.65. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 104.6Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 104.448Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 98.1Bcf/D. *

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 159.47Bcf. Today’s expected demand = 148.1Bcf. The “experts” expect peak power demand to set records over the coming days. Numerous power plants in Texas and the South are suffering malfunctions due to freezing temperatures. More power plant malfunctions can be expected. *

***BASIS**** – Both PG&E CG and SoCal Basis are heading back down towards their historical range for the forward months. Daily spot pricing remains high, between $3.00 to $5.00, depending on the delivery point, and at what time you price it. This downward trend should pick up pace by next week. *

*The PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. The SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. The SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – latest report shows 14.7Bcf/D. As demand across the globe falls, new terminals come online, and projects continue to increase, we could be looking at an LNG oversupply in the future. Could be bearish for C&I natural gas market.*

***RIG COUNT – ****The first rig count of 2024 (1-12-24) = 619. Oil rose by 2 rigs to 499 while the natural gas rig count fell by 1 to 117. The miscellaneous rig count is 3. *

***WEATHER**** – We are back to severe weather warnings for most of the US, now through the weekend. The NWS has wind chill advisories in effect from North Dakota to Florida. The Pac NW is expecting Artic Blast conditions. Well below normal temperatures (subzero to single digits) are expected today for the Plains region, moving to the Southern US region by tomorrow. The Great Lakes region could see up to 4ft. of snow now through the weekend. 6 – 10-day forecast = very bearish. 10-15-day forecast = very bearish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – Last week there was talk of a potential withdrawal over 300Bcf. Earlier this week the estimate fell to 159Bcf. The actual is a withdrawal of 154Bcf. We’re now 350Bcf above this time last year and 320Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,862Bcf. Art 3,182Bcf, working gas remains above the 5-year historical range. *

***RENEWABLE ENERGY (wind & solar) –**** Let’s see how reliable W&S are over the next few days as sunlight will be limited and windmills freeze up. I’m not posting this to simply bash W&S (their track record does that for them). I’m posting these facts to remind people on the unreliable, environment destroying renewable energy options. Tell me the last time a nuclear plant froze up or failed to produce power because it was cold outside with cloud coverage…*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****If Feb ’24 is going for under $2.75 right now, imagine what price it may fall to once this winter storm blows out over the Atlantic. NYMEX is cheap right now and could get even cheaper as storage remains ample, production and supply remain strong, and demand is not hitting the numbers that the “experts” expected.******This second round of harsh winter weather will pass, with warmer fronts following it. And whatever you do, stay within your daily nominated usage to minimize your risk of getting hit with daily cashout spot prices. We can expect OFOs to be called by PG&E, SoCalGas, and SDG&E now through to next week. Stay off the spot gas for now. *
