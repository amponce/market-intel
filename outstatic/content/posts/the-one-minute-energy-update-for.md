***\#NYMEXFallsAGAIN #PG&ECGBasisEndsTheWeekDown$1.10 #SoCalGasBasisEndsTheWeekDown$2.50 #WeatherIsABullThenABear #DemandUP #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– NYMEX has fallen nearly $0.80 in 1 week. More bears could be seen next week. *

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****Open = $2.71, High = $2.71, Low = $2.54, Current = $2.55. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.65 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.80 from 1 year ago. *

*We are below the 50-day ($2.77), the 20-day ($2.88), and the 9-day ($2.94) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.79, 2025 = $3.59, 2026 = $3.87. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.88/$3.06. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $2.77*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.58/$2.48. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 108.5Bcf. Supply 7-Day Avg. = 105.02Bcf. Estimated 7-Day Avg. Production = 95.6Bcf/D. *

*Demand 7-Day Avg. = 162.62Bcf. Today’s expected demand = 160.0Bcf.*

***BASIS**** – Both PG&E CG and SoCal Basis continue to fall. By this time next week, barring any disruptions in driving factors, we should see even better buying opportunities. *

*The PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. The SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. The SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – latest report shows 14.7Bcf/D. *

***RIG COUNT – ****The next rig count comes out later today. We’ve seen a 2-week slide in the rig count. Will we see a third straight week? *

***WEATHER**** – Most of the US will enjoy the perfect weekend weather for staying indoors, watching NFL playoff games. It is going to be well below normal with strong weather systems kicking up wind advisories. Stay indoors, and if you order delivery, tip the drivers well! *

*6 – 10-day forecast = very bearish. 10-15-day forecast = still bearish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – We’re now 350Bcf above this time last year and 320Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,862Bcf. Art 3,182Bcf, working gas remains above the 5-year historical range. *

***RENEWABLE ENERGY –**** Canary Media had this to say today, “Right now, the world is on track to reach about 7,300 gigawatts — or 7.3 terawatts you like — of total renewable capacity by 2028, a 75% increase over the cumulative 4.1 terawatts in 2023. And yet, despite this astounding growth, that would still fall short of the goal set at COP28 last year of tripling renewables by 2030 — a target that would require total renewable capacity to reach 11,000gigawatts.”. W&S is a joke and the only people laughing are the governments being paid to push this joke. Tens of billions of dollars from government programs (taxpayer funded) are going to companies for buying clean energy tax credits. It’s a farce. But it’s a farce that we can’t get around. Get on board and get yours.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****Prices are falling, both financial and physical. Our patience should pay off soon. Enjoy the weekend, don’t overthink it. Let’s be ready to execute. *
