***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/8/24***

***\#NYMEXDown #PG&ECGBasisDown #SoCalGasBasisDown #WeatherStillBullish #StorageStrong #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– So far today, NYMEX has been down as much as $0.17 on the prompt month. As bullish as weather systems are right now, it appears the other driving factors, all bearish are limiting the current bull run. *

***Today’s opening NYMEX price for Feb ‘24**** = $2.95, high = $2.96, low = $2.69, currently sitting @ $2.79. NYMEX prices are up approximately $0.25 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.90 from 1 year ago. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.95) and remain above the 20-day ($2.55) and the 9-day ($2.66) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.91, 2025 = $3.63, 2026 = $3.89. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. *

*2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.97/$3.05. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.74/$2.60. *

***BASIS**** – A lot of people were out last week so we are keeping this piece in for a few more days - We expect Demand to increase this Spring and Summer in the SW region. An increase in demand in the SW will most likely drive Basis prices up throughout California. The reason(s) for this – increased demand with numerous new facilities coming online in the SW region, increasing natural gas demand, as well as higher than normal temperatures being forecasted (at this time) for both seasons. *

*Both PG&E Basis and SoCal CG Basis are down today after last week’s bull run.*

*PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. *

*SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. *

*SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

*Current fixed price offers for 2024 – 2026 continue to be lower than the 2023 Index prices. *

***RIG COUNT – ****The first rig count of 2024 (1-5-24) = 619. Oil rose by 1 rig to 501 while the natural gas rig count fell by 2 to 118. *

***WEATHER**** – We have a full-on storm watch here in SoCal right now. People are wearing sweaters and jackets not for label purposes but for actual necessity. The rest of the U.S. north of Texas and Virgina are also getting the first taste of true cold this winter season. Not to worry, 2 weeks from now, we should be complaining that we didn’t get enough winter weather this season. Bullish 6 – 10-day forecast. Bullish 10-15-day forecast. Bearish 3-month forecast. Bullish Summer forecast.*

***STORAGE**** – We are now 553Bcf higher than we were last year and 399Bcf above the 5-year average 3,077Bcf. At 3,476Bcf, we are above the 5-year historical range.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****Winter weather finally showed up this weekend and will stick around for large chunks of the U.S for the next 10 days. Ride it out and be ready to execute when the bears return to both NYMEX and Basis. *****
