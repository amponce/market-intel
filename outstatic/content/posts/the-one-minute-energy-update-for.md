***\#NYMEXUp #PG&ECGBasisFallsFurther #SoCalGasBasisCollapsing #WeatherTurnsBullish #NaturalGasDemandBelowNormal #LNGExports #CarbonOffsets***

***NYMEX ****– Prices are up today, especially in the prompt month, due to weather charts shifting from above normal to near normal. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.87) but have moved above the and 20-day ($2.56) and 9-day ($2.52) averages. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.*

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $260, 2025 = $3.42, 2026 = $3.72. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.60/$2.65. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 110.6Bcf/D. Supply 7 Day Avg. as of 12-22-23 = 110.27Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 103.5Bcf/D. Daily production for Winter 2023/2024 is expected to average 101.7Bcf/D. *

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 136.7Bcf as of 12-22-23. Today’s expected demand = 125.3Bcf.*

***RIG COUNT – ****As of 12-22-23 – Overall rig**** ****count = 620. We’re down 3 rigs from last week and down 157 rigs from last year. Oil fell by 3 rigs to 498, gas increased by 1 rig for a total of 120 (and down 35 rigs from this time last year), and miscellaneous rigs fell by 1. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis continues to fall closer to the historical range. The big news today is the collapse of SoCal CG Basis. Some months are now beating the SoCal Border Basis. Other months are getting close to negative prices. We are in a good place for the next few weeks for buying 2024 SoCal CG Basis and SoCal Border Basis. Plan on buying Basis after 1-1-24. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Latest average (12-22-23) = 14.6Bcf/D. *

***WEATHER**** – Mild temperatures in West/Pac NW/Rockies. Colder fronts in the Mid-Con/NE/SE are pushing prices up today. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows above normal for the Pac NW, Rockies, and the northern plains through to Minnesota. The Southeast has below normal forecasts while the rest of the U.S. has near normal forecasts. The 10-15-day forecast calls for above normal temperatures all along the northern border, below normal for the SW, and near normal for the rest of the U.S.*

***STORAGE**** – Last week’s storage forecast was an 85Bcf withdrawal. The actual report came in with an 87Bcf withdrawal, putting us 240Bcf above last year at this time and 280Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,297Bcf. At 3,577Bcf, we remain above the 5-year historical range. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. And for those of you here in the Tarnished State of California, our state government will be mandating that you do so soon enough. So, best to get on board before they force you onboard. To give you an idea, looking at today’s menu, we have Indonesia Hydro projects going for $0.50/tonne (always measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, or CO2e) to Honduras Cookstove projects going for $12.00/tonne. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*
