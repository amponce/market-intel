***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/11/24***

***\#NYMEXUp #PG&ECGBasisDown #SoCalGasBasisDown #Weather #DemandIncreasingThisWeekend #StorageWithdrawal140Bcf #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– Prompt month is up as much as $0.20 this morning, wiping out yesterday’s downturn. NYMEX prices show green through Feb ’26 followed by red through Nov ‘33. *

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****open = $3.02, high = 3.18, low = $2.94, currently @ $3.16. NYMEX prices are up approximately $0.10 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.45 from 1 year ago. *

*We are above the 50-day ($2.87), the 20-day ($2.61), and the 9-day ($2.81) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $3.01, 2025 = $3.66, 2026 = $3.91. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $3.19/$3.34. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $3.07*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.92/$2.80. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***BASIS**** – A lot of people were out last week so we are keeping this piece in for a few more days - We expect Demand to increase this Spring and Summer in the SW region. An increase in demand in the SW will most likely drive Basis prices up throughout California. The reason(s) for this – increased demand with numerous new facilities coming online in the SW region, increasing natural gas demand, as well as higher than normal temperatures being forecasted (at this time) for both seasons. *

*Both PG&E Basis and SoCal Basis are down today. This could be due to the coming shift in weather for the Golden State over the next few days. *

*PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

*Current fixed price offers for 2024 – 2026 continue to be lower than the 2023 Index prices. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 106.7Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 109.42Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 101.7Bcf/D. *

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 134.25Bcf. Today’s expected demand = 135.4Bcf. Moderate demand through Friday with an increase over the weekend.*

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Moving up close to 15bcf/D. *

***RIG COUNT – ****The first rig count of 2024 (1-5-24) = 619. Oil rose by 1 rig to 501 while the natural gas rig count fell by 2 to 118. *

***WEATHER**** – Single and negative digits throughout the Dakotas and Mid-Con. 60s and 70s from L.A. to Jacksonville. Warmer throughout the South/SE. Warmer than yesterday along the Eastern seaboard. 6 – 10-day forecast = bullish. 10-15-day forecast = more bearish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – After blasting the “experts” last week on their ridiculous storage estimates, no estimates were received this week. Thicken the skin, “experts”. The latest storage report (1-11-24) shows a withdrawal of 140Bcf. We are now 436Bcf higher than we were last year and 348Bcf above the 5-year average 2,988Bcf. At 3,336Bcf, we are above the 5-year historical range. End of winter storage levels are bearish with estimates around 1.95Tcf, and injection season ending close to 4Tcf.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****Patience is key right now. We have an abundant supply, could see record storage at the end of withdrawal season and injection season. We get through this current weather system, experience no capacity/pipeline disruptions, and we should be in good buying positions. HOWEVER, let’s not get too comfortable for this very real reason – wind and solar continue to underperform even though more money is being thrown at these two <s>unreliable</s>

 renewable energies. Latest reports show these two <s>unreliable</s>

 renewable energies will have to expand at twice the current rate to meet their unobtainable goals set for 2030. So….…because of these two useless energy sources, natural gas will be relied upon even more than it already is for power generation. As we have said for some time now, the more we get rid of natural gas, the more we need it. Hydrogen is a great clean energy source but too much money has been thrown at W&S, so hydrogen must wait. Nuclear is the smart solution but just try pushing it in front of W&S in terms of projects. Won’t happen. Too many deep pockets have put forth billions in W&S, paid our government plenty, and now they want their return on investment. By the time the Gretas of the world realize it was all a sham, the people responsible will be long gone. So, it all falls back to one of the most reliable and cleanest energy sources in the world that already has a great infrastructure built, and that energy source is natural gas. And this is why we need to remember that natural gas is a commodity that is very volatile and should be taken advantage of when the market gives us opportunities to buy low. *
