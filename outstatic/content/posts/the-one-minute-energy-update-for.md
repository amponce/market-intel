***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 12/29/23***

***This is THE last 1-minute energy update for 2023. RFP Energy would like to wish you all the very best in 2024!***

***\#AllThingsBearish #NYMEXRallyStalls #PG&ECGBasisFlat #SoCalGasBasisFlat #WeatherTurningBearishAgain #AlisoCanyonStorageStrong #CarbonOffsets***

***NYMEX ****– Prices are flat today with yesterday’s small bull run stalling. Most months remain well below the NYMEX yearly average for the past 3 years. And we continue to beat the next 3 years of projected averages. *

***Today’s opening NYMEX price for Feb ‘24**** = $2.53, high = $2.56, low = $2.48, currently sitting @ $2.55. NYMEX prices are flat from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.15 from 1 year ago. *

*We remain below the 50-day ($2.86), are $0.01 above the 20-day ($2.54) and $0.02 above the 9-day ($2.53) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.70, 2025 = $3.50, 2026 = $3.80. *

***2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle averaged $6.64. 2021 averaged $3.84. 2020 averaged $2.07.***

***BASIS**** – Just like NYMEX, yesterday’s rally for both PG&E Basis SoCal CG Basis seems to be stalling out. Driving factors remain more bearish than bullish. Let’s plan on locking up Basis next week when the trade desks are back to full staff and traders are looking to hit the ground running. You can practically smell the start of the calendar year desperation already. *

***PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. ***

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $2.61/$2.67. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.45/$2.35. *

***WEATHER**** – Colder temperatures throughout most of the U.S today. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows above normal for the Dakotas, west Great Lakes, and New England, near normal from WA/OR to NY down to VA, and below normal for SoCal across to GA. The 10-15-day forecast calls for below normal temperatures for the West and Rockies, near normal for the Mid-Con, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic, and above normal for the Great lakes and New England. *

***STORAGE**** – After yesterday’s Storage Report, we are 348Bcf above last year at this time and 316Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,174Bcf. At 3,490Bcf, we remain well within the 5-year historical range. *

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*
