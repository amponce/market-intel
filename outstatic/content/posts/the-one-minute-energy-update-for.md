***NYMEX**** – 5 straight days of downward movement. Is it leveling off? Today’s opening price for Dec ‘23 = $3.03, high = $3.07, low = $2.98, currently sitting @ $3.02. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.37 from 1 week ago and down approximately $3.45 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2023 Balance = $3.04, 2024 = $3.36, 2025 = $4.11. *

***RESISTANCE**** –Starting @ $3.12/$3.21. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $2.98/$2.93. *

***PRODUCTION & DEMAND**** – Production = 102.4Bcf/D. Overall supply = 107.9Bcf/D.*

*Demand - = 108.9Bcf/D. *

***RIG COUNT ****– Today’s rig count will be released later today. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis is up approximately $0.20 - $0.30 across the 12-month board. SoCal Basis is also up about $0.20 for the next 12 months. This is a great example of how widely and how quickly the pendulum for California Basis swings. When it comes to Basis, we need to pick a target trigger price and when it hits, we execute, reducing the risk of being caught with a higher Basis price.*

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Latest daily export = 13.9Bcf. *

***WEATHER**** – Colder temperatures for most of the U.S today. The 6 – 10-day forecast shows near normal for the West coast, above normal for most of the U.S., and downright balmy for the Mid-Con. The 10-15-day forecast continues to show near normal for the West, below normal for SoCal, and above normal for the rest of the U.S.*

***STORAGE**** – The next storage report will be released by EIA 11-16-23.*

***CA RETAIL POWER**** – jumps up over $65MWH. *
