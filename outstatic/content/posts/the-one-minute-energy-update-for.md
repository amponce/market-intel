***10/19/23***

***\#NYMEX #NYMEXFallingAgain #NaturalGasProduction***

***\#PG&ECGBasisRemainsStillUp #SoCalCGBasisStillUp #AlisoCanyonStartsInjectingThisWeekend #CAISOPricesUp ***

***\#DemandFalling #BearishWeather***

***NYMEX**** – Today’s open = $3.07, high = $3.09, low = $2.96, currently sitting @ $3.00. Nov ’23 is down as much as $0.08 today. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.40 from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.80 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** = $3.26 for balance of 2023, 2024 = $3.50, 2025 = $4.02. *

***RESISTANCE**** \- Starting @ $3.12. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $3.01, followed by $2.90. *

***PRODUCTION & DEMAND**** – Production – Averaging 103.5Bcf/D so far in Oct ‘23. This week = 104.5BCF/D. Next week’s estimate = 102.4Bcf/D. Last year = 99.5Bcf/D. 5 yr. avg. = 93.1Bcf/D.*

* Demand - Last week = 94.6Bcf/D. This week = 97.2Bcf/D. Next week’s estimate = 96.1BCF/D. Last year = 99.8Bcf/D. 5 yr. avg. = 88.8Bcf/D.*

***RIG COUNT –* ***Next Rig Count = 10-20-23.**Last week’s rig count = + 4 for oil with a total of 501 active oil rigs. Last week’s natural gas rig count = - 1 for a total of 117 active natural gas rigs. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis remain elevated. We could see downward pressure on both delivery points once Aliso Canyon starts injecting gas for winter storage (starting 10-21-23 after a 2-week delay). We should also see downward pressure in SoCal once SoCalGas brings back 650,000MMBtu of BTS natgas. Looking to lock in a Nov ’23 today may be the wrong choice. It might be better to play the First of the Month Index for Nov ’23 only. We’ll see next week…*

***LNG**** – Exports hit 14.6Bcf/D on 10-17-23, the highest export volume since April ’23.*

***WEATHER**** – Some heat in the SW, TX, and Gulf regions. Sunny until you hit the home of The Replacements and Husker Du. Rain from the Great Lakes to Atlanta. Big storms forecasted for the NE/Mid-Atlantic regions this weekend. *

***STORAGE**** – End of season storage estimates = 3.8Tcf. The latest estimate for today’s storage report was +83Bcf. The actual injection was 97Bcf. We’re now 300Bcf above last year at this time and only 175Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,451Bcf. At 3,626Bcf, total working gas remains within the 5-year historical range. *
