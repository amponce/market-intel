***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/10/24***

***\#NYMEXDown #PG&ECGBasisDown #SoCalGasBasisUp #Weather #DemandIncreasingThisWeekend #StorageStrong #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– Prompt month is down as much as $0.20 this morning. NYMEX prices showing red through July ’27. *

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****open = $3.16, high = 3.16, low = $2.97, currently @ $2.99. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.10 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.80 from 1 year ago. *

*We are above the 50-day ($2.83), the 20-day ($2.62), and the 9-day ($2.80) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $3.01, 2025 = $3.66, 2026 = $3.91. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. *

*2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $3.42/$3.66. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.91/$2.64. *

***BASIS**** – A lot of people were out last week so we are keeping this piece in for a few more days - We expect Demand to increase this Spring and Summer in the SW region. An increase in demand in the SW will most likely drive Basis prices up throughout California. The reason(s) for this – increased demand with numerous new facilities coming online in the SW region, increasing natural gas demand, as well as higher than normal temperatures being forecasted (at this time) for both seasons. *

*PG&E Basis is down today while SoCal Basis is up. *

*PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. *

*SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. *

*SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

*Current fixed price offers for 2024 – 2026 continue to be lower than the 2023 Index prices. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 109.7Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 109.91Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 104.7Bcf/D. Demand expected to be increase over the weekend. *

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 134.12Bcf, up over 7Bcf from prior week. Today’s expected demand = 130.3Bcf. Moderate demand through Friday with an increase over the weekend.*

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Moving up close to 15bcf/D. *

***RIG COUNT – ****The first rig count of 2024 (1-5-24) = 619. Oil rose by 1 rig to 501 while the natural gas rig count fell by 2 to 118. *

***WEATHER**** – Blizzards in the Pac NW, tornadoes in the Southeast, heavy rain and wind hit the East Coast, snow in Mid–Con, flooding from Washington DC to Boston. The balance of this work week looks like this; 40s – 70s through the South, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, 10s - 30s in the Plains, -10s to 20s for the Rockies and Mid-Con, rolling through the rest of the U.S. by next week. 6 – 10-day forecast more bullish. 10-15-day forecast = bearish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – We are now 553Bcf higher than we were last year and 399Bcf above the 5-year average 3,077Bcf. At 3,476Bcf, we are above the 5-year historical range.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****Even with strong winter weather rolling through large portions of the U.S. this week and into next week, demand remains moderate overall. Storage remains strong. Supply is strong. Production is strong. We will see prices increase before we see, I believe, a strong downward correction later this month. *
