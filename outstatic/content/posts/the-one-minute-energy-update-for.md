***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/9/24***

***\#NYMEXUp #PG&ECGBasisUp #SoCalGasBasisUp #WeatherDrivingRallies #StorageStrong #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– Weather is king once again. NYMEX rallied late yesterday to over $3.00 for the prompt month and that rally carries over into today. We’re up roughly 5% from yesterday at this hour. *

***Today’s opening NYMEX price for Feb ‘24**** = $2.94, high = 3.16, low = $2.88, currently sitting @ $3.10. NYMEX prices are up approximately $0.75 from 1 week ago and down approximately $0.60 from 1 year ago. *

*We are now above the 50-day ($2.83), the 20-day ($2.59), and the 9-day ($2.74) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.91, 2025 = $3.61, 2026 = $3.91. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. *

*2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. *

*2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $3.09/$3.21. *

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.90/$2.80. *

***BASIS**** – A lot of people were out last week so we are keeping this piece in for a few more days - We expect Demand to increase this Spring and Summer in the SW region. An increase in demand in the SW will most likely drive Basis prices up throughout California. The reason(s) for this – increased demand with numerous new facilities coming online in the SW region, increasing natural gas demand, as well as higher than normal temperatures being forecasted (at this time) for both seasons. *

*Both PG&E Basis and SoCal CG Basis are up strong today due to weather. *

*PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. *

*SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. *

*SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

*Current fixed price offers for 2024 – 2026 continue to be lower than the 2023 Index prices. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – Moving up close to 15bcf/D. *

***RIG COUNT – ****The first rig count of 2024 (1-5-24) = 619. Oil rose by 1 rig to 501 while the natural gas rig count fell by 2 to 118. *

***WEATHER**** – We can expect winter weather to increase through 1-15-24. 6 – 10-day forecast still bullish. 10-15-day forecast = turning bearish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*



***STORAGE**** – We are now 553Bcf higher than we were last year and 399Bcf above the 5-year average 3,077Bcf. At 3,476Bcf, we are above the 5-year historical range.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****Winter weather is in full command right now and will remain in control over the next 2 weeks. We should see some strong downward corrections by 1-22-24. We continue to ride out the winter storm. Production is strong. Demand is up now, could break records by 1-15-24, but will fall off by late Jan ’24. Patience is key. Gordon Gecko said not to get emotional about stock. The same applies to this commodity. *****
