***THE 1 Minute Energy Update for 1/17/24***

***\#NYMEXDropsLikeARock #PG&ECGBasisFalling #SoCalGasBasisFalling #WeatherFading #DemandWayUp #AlisoCanyonStillStrong #CarbonOffsets ***

***NYMEX ****– The Prompt month dropped over $0.40 yesterday. As quickly as it ran up, it ran down even quicker. Don’t be foolish enough to think it won’t or can’t happen again. This commodity will continue to be volatile, which is why it is imperative that we take advantage of down markets.*

***NYMEX pricing so far today - ****open = $2.84, high = $2.85, low = $2.75, currently @ $2.82. NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.45 from 1 week ago and down approximately $1.00 from 1 year ago. *

*We are above the 50-day ($2.79) and the 20-day ($2.78), but below the 9-day ($3.03) average. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES**** – 2024 = $2.84, 2025 = $3.58, 2026 = $3.84. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $3.11/$3.33. *

***THE PIVOT**** @ $2.97*

***SUPPORT**** - Starting @ $2.75/$2.60. *

*2023 NYMEX Monthly Final Settle average = $2.73. 2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64. 2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84. *

***PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & DEMAND**** – Today’s Est. Supply = 102.3Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 104.628Bcf. Today’s Estimated Production = 98.5Bcf/D. *

*Demand 7 Day Avg. = 157.328Bcf. Today’s expected demand = 162.3Bcf. Demand is expected to be high from 1-17-24 to 1-22-24. *

***BASIS**** – Both PG&E CG and SoCal Basis are heading back down towards their historical range for the forward months. Daily spot pricing remains high, between $3.00 to $5.00, depending on the delivery point, and at what time you price it. This downward trend should continue as weather gets back to normal here in the West. Any changes to the norm and we can expect upward movement. *

*The PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83 for 2023. The SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95 for 2023. The SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14 for 2023. *

***LNG EXPORTS**** – latest report shows 14.7Bcf/D. As demand across the globe falls and projects continue to increase, we could be looking at an LNG oversupply by year’s end. Could be bearish for C&I natural gas market.*

***RIG COUNT – ****The first rig count of 2024 (1-12-24) = 619. Oil rose by 2 rigs to 499 while the natural gas rig count fell by 1 to 117. The miscellaneous rig count is 3. *

***WEATHER**** – Warming in the Pac NW, West, SW, and Texas. Frigid in the Dakotas and Mid-Con. Northeast and New England, you’re next. Below normal temperatures in the Southeast and Gulf states. 6 – 10-day forecast = very bearish. 10-15-day forecast = bearish. 3-month forecast = bearish. Summer forecast = bullish.*

***STORAGE**** – The expected withdrawal from Storage this Thursday is 304Bcf. If it hits, it will be the 3rd largest withdrawal in history. We can expect some larger than normal withdrawals this week and next. So much so that we may now enter the Injection season below the comfortable level of 2Tcf. That makes things more bullish than bearish.*

***RENEWABLE ENERGY (wind & solar) -**** Developers of renewable energy projects selling unused U.S. tax credits to other companies now account for a market worth between $7 billion and $9 billion, buoyed by legislation in 2022 that made these trades possible. And you wonder why so many people are pushing this unreliable, expensive, weak energy source. It certainly isn’t because it’s good for you, your wellbeing, or mother earth.*

***CARBON OFFSETS – ****Many of our supply partners offer carbon offset with a vast menu to choose from if you are looking to shrink your carbon footprint. Feel free to contact us for more on carbon offsets whenever you like.*

***THE BOTTOM LINE – ****All driving factors are becoming more bearish for the next few weeks if there are no changes in weather, production, supply, demand, capacity, and deliverability. *
