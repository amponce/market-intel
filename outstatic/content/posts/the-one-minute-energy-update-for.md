***THE 1 Minute Energy Report for 10/27/23***

***\#NYMEX #NYMEXBullish #PG&EBasisFalling #SoCalBasisFalling ***

***\#Weather ***

***NYMEX**** – Today is the 5th straight day where we’re seeing NYMEX in the green. Today’s opening price = $3.25, high = $3.40, low = $3.24, currently sitting @ $3.33. Nov ’23 is up as much as $0.20 so far today. NYMEX prices are up $0.20 from 1 week ago and down approximately $2.20 from 1 year ago. *

***NYMEX CALENDAR ESTIMATES**** – 2023 Balance = $3.34, 2024 = $3.49, 2025 = $4.04. *

***RESISTANCE**** – Starting @ $3.33/$3.45. ****SUPPORT**** \- Starting @ $3.03/$2.85. *

***PRODUCTION & DEMAND**** – Production – Up to 102.6Bcf/D, up 1.3Bcf from last week. Supply as of 10-27-23 = 108.1Bcf. Last week = 101.3Bcf/D. Next week’s estimate = 102.4Bcf/D. Last year = 102.2Bcf/D. 3 yr. avg. = 97.2Bcf/D.*

* Demand – 7-day average = 98.6BCf. Expected to increase to 104Bcf next week. Driven by weather.*

***RIG COUNT ****– The rig count has increased for two straight weeks. Will we have a third straight week? We’ll find out later this morning when the report comes out after 10AM, PST. *

***BASIS**** – PG&E Basis continues to fall, as does SoCal Basis. Better weather lowering the cooling demand along with storage injections into Aliso Canyon are helping this downward correction. *

***LNG**** – Exports averaging 11.4Bc/D for 2023. This week’s average = 14.3Bcf/D. The “experts” expect LNG exports to increase by 12.9Bcf/D over the next 5 years. My opinion - that makes C&I natgas pricing very bullish if no new pipeline/production projects are not ramped up. *

***WEATHER**** – Strong cold front from Seattle to Minneapolis. The rest of the U.S. enjoying temps in the 70’s and 80’s today. The 6–10-day forecast shows above normal temperatures for the West, below normal temps moving out of the Mid-Con and into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, and Texas. The 10 – 15 forecast shows above normal temperatures for the Wes, Rockies, Mid-Con, Texas, Gulf. Near normal temperatures are forecasted for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. t with the remainder of the U.S. near normal.*

***STORAGE**** – End of season storage estimates = 3.8Tcf. *
