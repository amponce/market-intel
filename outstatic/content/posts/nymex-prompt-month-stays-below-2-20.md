🌟 THE One Minute Energy Update for 7-17-24 🌟

Let's dive into the latest energy updates:

🔹 CAISO Victory Lap: 🏅 CAISO is flexing its muscles as the CA power grid handled higher-than-usual demand during the recent heatwave. NatGas power was the hero, while W&S power didn’t contribute much. 💪🔌

🔹 Nuclear Boost: ⚛️ The ADVANCE Act, with bipartisan support, was signed into law to speed up nuclear energy deployment like never before since the 70s, meeting the growing US power grid demand. 🚀

🔹 NYMEX Update: 📉 Aug '24 & Sep '24 remain below $2.20. Prices are dropping due to cooler weather forecasts.

🔹 LNG Delays: 🛑 Freeport LNG’s comeback is slower than expected.
