\
As we progress into the summer season, it is important to remain vigilant about the potential changes in the natural gas market, despite the current levels of relatively low prices.\
\
Key Points to Consider:\
\
Intense Heat Waves: We are already observing intense heat in the Desert Southwest. More critically, Mexico is expected to experience some of the highest temperatures ever recorded over the next 10 to 15 days.\
\
Competition for Supply: The increased demand for cooling in response to this heat will heighten competition for natural gas molecules, particularly those flowing south towards Mexico. This competition is expected to contribute to increased price volatility in the region.\
\
Market Impact: It is crucial for all stakeholders, especially commercial and industrial end users, to prepare for these conditions which signify just the beginning of what could be a highly volatile period.\
Recommendations:\
\
Monitor Developments Closely: Stay updated with the latest market trends and forecasts.\
\
Evaluate Supply Contracts: Ensure that your current agreements are robust enough to handle potential price fluctuations.\
\
Risk Management: Consider strategies to mitigate the impact of rising prices, such as fixed-price contracts or other financial hedges.\
\
This alert serves as a reminder not to become complacent with the current low natural gas prices as the market dynamics can shift rapidly, particularly under extreme weather conditions.\
