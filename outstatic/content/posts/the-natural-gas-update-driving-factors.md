THE NATURAL GAS UPDATE FOR 2-10-23 THE DRIVING FACTORS

**NYMEX **– NYMEX is about the same as it was this time last week, but compared to this time last year, NYMEX is approximately $1.75 cheaper. We could be taking advantage of this by buying NYMEX now and waiting/hoping/praying for West basis to weaken in a few weeks.<br>

<br>

**BASIS** – West basis is getting better but we still have a way to go to get back into the historical range. Three weeks from now could be the time.<br>

<br>

**RIG COUNT** – Last week’s oil & gas rig count put us 146 active rigs ahead of the rig count for this week in 2022. This week’s rig count was unavailable at the time of the THE Natural Gas Update going out.<br>

<br>

**PRODUCTION** – With NYMEX prices dropping 46% already this year, there is fear that production could slow to prevent further downward runs in price. For now, we continue to chase 100Bcf/D production.<br>

<br>

**DEMAND** – Reuters is reporting that demand for natgas is expected to fall to 87Bcf/D in 2023, and 86Bcf/D in2024. 2022 set the record with a drop down to 88Bcf/D.<br>

<br>

**CRUDE** – Daily production for 2023 is expected to increase by nearly 600,000 barrels. Even though production is set to increase, it’s still a slowdown in terms of volume growth. Rising costs, shrinking reserves, pressure to pull back spending are the driving factors in limiting production.<br>

<br>

**NUCLEAR** – Hate it as they may, a LOT of people whose job it is to <s>rule </s>

serve the American people are finding ways to redefine nuclear energy for it to fit their renewables initiative. Even woke universities are finding ways to say, “forget what we protested about in the past, nuclear power is AWESOME! We love it!” More proof that reality and fact beat theory and cotton candy dreams…. eventually.<br>

<br>

**RENEWABLES** – This sector is expected to increase contribution from 21% to 24% in 2023 and up to 26% contribution in 2024. This is great for the residential market but let’s not think S/W can heat run a foundry any time soon. Perspective is a great thing to have, people!\*\*ITEMS OF INTEREST \*\*- Here in the West this week, PG&E CG prices fell by as much as $11. SoCal CG fell by as much as $13. Once we get past this cold spell, we could see basis prices fall further. After being shut in from a 2021 explosion, Line 2000 opens back up next week, adding 600,000MMBtu/D West bound natgas to El Paso and SoCal pipelines and is expected to reach full capacity by 3-15-23. After 3-15-23, we’re in the (historical) center of the spring shoulder season…..<br>

<br>

**THE BOTTOM LINE** – ….and once we’re in the spring shoulder season, temps should be back to normal in the West, HDDs and CDDs should be a non-factor, pipeline capacity coming West should be as close to full capacity as it gets. The next 4-6 weeks could be our best time to execute fixed prices. Be ready.

**NATURAL GAS PRICING**<br>

**First of the Month Pricing Average for 2022**<br>

**PG&E CG = $8.30 SoCal CG = $8.38**<br>

**12 MO FIXED PRICES ARE BEATING THE ABOVE 2022 AVERAGES BY MORE THAN $2.00**

**Indicative Fixed Prices as of 2/10/2023**

Start Date Term PG&E CG SoCal CG

March ’23 1 mo. $4.71 $4.16<br>

March ’23 3 mo. $4.83 $4.19<br>

March ’23 6 mo. $5.08 $5.19<br>

March ’23 12 mo. $5.90 $6.21

All Fixed Prices are down from last week’s natgas update.

**STORAGE REPORT - **The latest natgas storage report shows a withdrawal of 217Bcf. This is above the guesstimate of 197Bcf.

We're now 233Bcf higher than this time last year and 117Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,420Bcf.

At 2,366Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. The storage level by the start of injection season (March ’23) is projected down from 1.9Tcf to 1.85Bcf and build up to 4.25Tcf by the end of Injection Season. Strong.

**WEATHER- **This forecast could slow the anticipated downturn of West region Basis prices. This could be a good thing for us – gives everyone time to get everything lined up and ready to go so that when the fall comes, you’re ready.
