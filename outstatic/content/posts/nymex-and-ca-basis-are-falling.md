Temperatures are comfortable across the Northwest and Great Plains w/highs of 60s to 80s as weather systems linger. Texas will cool the next couple days into the 70s and 80s due to heavy rains from a tropical system in the Gulf of Mexico. Much of the US will be very warm to hot this weekend into next week w/highs of 80-100s, hottest SW deserts.”*

*5 – 10-day forecast = bullish.  10-15-day forecast = bullish.  3-month forecast = turning bearish.  Summer (July – Sep) forecast = turning bearish.*

***CRUDE –*** *Up.  Current Cash price = $78.62.  Forward estimates: 2024 = $79.62, 2025 = $74.74, 2026 = $70.67.  2023 saw the highest consumption of crude on file.  It’s not going away, we’ll continue to rely more and more on it, regardless of what Greta Thunberg says.* 

***CA RETAIL POWER*** *– CAISO pricing moves up to just over $18 per MWH.* 

***CARBON OFFSETS –*** *California and other states will be mandating companies buy carbon offsets, starting as early as 2025.  Is your company ready for that mandate?  Better to get ahead of the 2025 demand – more options, greater price range.  We can help.* 

***THE BOTTOM LINE*** *– NYMEX is above the historical buying range (we have enjoyed in the past) of $2.50 - $2.75.  Both Citygate delivery points show months with pricing at or below the historical range.  If you think we’ll see this downward trend become constant, you’re wrong.*
