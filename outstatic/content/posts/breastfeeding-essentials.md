### [Silverettes with silicone ring](https://amzn.to/3uDIsBY)

My number one recommendation is silverettes. They are a must-have for anyone nursing and help with healing sore nipples. To use, just squeeze a little breastmilk out after nursing and rub it around your nipple area then cover with silverette and wear underneath your bra. The easiest way to clean is to wash them in the shower and then dry with a cloth (be sure to dry inside the silicone ring each time). They are comfortable enough to wear 24/7 and sleep in.

### [Breast shells](https://amzn.to/46VjATL)

Breast shells are a life saver if you have extremely sore or cracked nipples, especially in the first couple months of nursing. They help keep clothing (or anything for that matter) from touching your nipples while they heal. You can put a little breastmilk on your nipples and then wear these under your bra if you're in a lot of pain. Once you're feeling better, you can stop using these and switch to silverettes.

### [Double electric breast pump](https://amzn.to/3uAeAGm)

If you are pumping, you're going to want an electric pump. This one has comfortable rings around the flanges that won't dig into your skin. Be sure to measure your nipple size and ensure you're using the correct flange size and replace your pump parts every few months if you're using it often.

### [Nursing pillow for 0–6 month olds](https://amzn.to/46A8hQF)

This nursing pillow has the perfect amount of firmness and provides a flat, supportive surface for your baby while they nurse. It works best for young babies, up until about 6 months old.

### [Nursing blanket](https://amzn.to/47EY4DH)

After your baby is too big for the nursing pillow, a good next step is to use a blanket underneath them instead. It lets you prop them up as much or as little as your need and is a comfortable place for them to be while they are nursing. My daughter has a strong association with this blanket and comfort since it's what she has always used while nursing. I highly recommend this one since it's so soft and washed well.

### [Nursing cover](https://amzn.to/3T6iTmY)

This cover is made from modal and spandex which makes it incredibly soft and had the perfect amount of stretch.
