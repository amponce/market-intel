After hitting a 3 ½ month high on Monday NYMEX prices began to fall late yesterday. That downward trend continues today as Texas temperatures/humidity weaken and the Lone Star state should feel a little less like hell on earth by the weekend. And now that the Wagner group has backed down (shortest rebellion since…ever?), the threat of disruption to Russian production is almost as weak as the rebellion itself. Another great example that the driving factors for natural gas pricing here in the U.S are no longer domestic only. This increases price volatility.

PG&E CG Basis falls a few more cents. The big surprise today is SoCal CG Basis - down over $1.00 from just 2 days ago for July '23, wiping out the Monday gain for this delivery/price point. Tomorrow’s Storage Report is forecasted to post an 83Bcf injection. Compare that to 81Bf last year and a 5-year average of 80Bcf.
