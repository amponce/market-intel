If you enjoyed yesterday’s bull run, then you are LOVING today’s follow up. Remember to breathe.

This bull run was overdue and inevitable. And so is a downward correction once the driving factors change direction.

NYMEX is up as much as $0.23 on the prompt month, seeing green all the way through May ‘25.

PG&E CG Basis is up and down a few pennies. SoCal CG Basis is starting to fall for most months, over the next 18 months. This is probably due to the Wheeler pipeline finishing up maintenance before the weekend. Once normal weather returns, we should see both Basis points fall.

Your opportunities are coming over the next 6 weeks. You might want to be ready to transact quickly. Are you set up to transact quickly?

For now, one particular song from (the legendary) Rage Against the Machine comes to mind - Bulls on Parade.
