NYMEX is shedding a few pennies this morning after an above forecast storage report. More on Storage in a second. We’re expected to get our first true taste of summer next week here in the Golden State so we will see how much Basis reacts to that heat and anticipated increase in cooling demand. We expect it to react but by how much is the question. We’re down a dime from this time last week and down around $2.90 from a year ago.

It seems that traders trading west basis positions are extra twitchy these days. Nobody wants to be short on their basis positions and that’s bringing some real discounted daily spot opportunities. You can see the daily fire sales when comparing daily spot and day ahead pricing with prompt month (and forward months) pricing. If you’ve got the stomach to play the daily purchase game with your company’s natgas noms, now is your time. How much time you have is TBD. Forward Basis is moving all over the place right now. We’ve enjoyed a steady downward trend for both PG&E and SoCal for the past 6 weeks. Now we’re seeing strong moves up and down daily. What does that tell you???

Now for the storage report - We’re roughly 25 % above last year and 15% above the 5-year average for this time of year. The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 65Bcf. The actual number comes in at 72Bcf. We're now 575Bcf higher than this time last year and 366Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,511Bcf. At 2,877Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season levels are expected to be at a record setting 4.1Tcf.

Have a great weekend. Bodhi says “Hi!”.
