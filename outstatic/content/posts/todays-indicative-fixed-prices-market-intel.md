8-10-23

The latest storage report shows an injection of 29Bcf. The estimate was 25Bcf. We’re now 55Bcf above last year and 305Bcf above the 5-year average. Storage here in CA is closing the gap on last year and the 5-year average but still show a deficit when injections are replaced with withdrawals.

This injection is pushing NYMEX prices down, taking back a large chunk of the gains seen over the previous 2 days. The prompt is down as much as $0.18 so far today with months posting in the red through Dec ’24.

PG&E CG Basis remains flat, with movement no more than a few cents.

SoCal CG, if you didn’t see our posting late afternoon yesterday, is falling hard. Wheeler Pipeline is back up and running, adding back 650,000MMBtu/D to the overall SoCal supply.

Once the current heatwave subsides, we should see Basis and NYMEX prices fall from where they currently sit.
