Please note that RFP ES will be closed Monday in observance of Juneteenth.

NYMEX is up approximately $0.10 so far today. That’s a $0.30 jump in just 2 days, a 10% – 15% increase depending on the month.

Heat in the Plains/Midwest/Texas is driving up power generation demand right now. Texas power plants have been sending out emergency notices all week. We may have seen the last of the bearish NYMEX, at least until cooling demand and power generation demand falls. As the Happenings sang, “See you in September”.

California Basis prices are tightening up as well, at all delivery points. Like NYMEX prices, we may be seeing the last of the 2023 buying opportunities over the next few weeks.

Fixed prices are up across the board today.
