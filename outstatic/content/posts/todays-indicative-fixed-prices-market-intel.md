NYMEX is down almost $0.10 on the prompt month. Indicative Fixed prices are all up for the second straight day PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis pricing both seem to be leveling off after their 4-week downward movement. PG&E CG Basis is flattening out while SoCal CG Basis is up in the immediate months, down in other months.
