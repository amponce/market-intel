7-21-23

NYMEX summer months dialed it back a few cents today after yesterday’s $0.20+ 1 day rally. From Dec ’23 out, NYMEX monthly prices are up. Midrange resistance comes in right where NYMEX Aug ’23 is sitting, at $2.70. Downward support will take off once we get below $2.50 but don’t expect that to hit any time soon.

Not to be out done on this current bull run, PG&E CG Basis is up approximately $0.60+ from just 2 days ago. SoCal CG Basis is up over $1.00 from just 2 days ago.

The current weather forecast gives strength to bulls sticking around for the remainder of July ’23. Weather driven demand is the main driving factor right now.
