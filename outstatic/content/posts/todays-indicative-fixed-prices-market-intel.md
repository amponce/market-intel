*9-14-23*

*NYMEX is down a few cents from yesterday. The open @ $2.71, high@ $2.82, low @ $2.70, now sitting @ $2.72. The balance of 2023 is green, followed by red through May ’25. NYMEX prompt month remains above the 9 day, 20 day, and 50 day average of $2.65. *

*NYMEX prices are up $0.20 from 1 week ago and down $5.55 from 1 year ago. *

*NYMEX continues to trade below the estimated 2023 average of $3.17.*

*The national weather chart shows slightly more heat today than yesterday in the SW and West TX region. Other than that, milder temperatures for the U.S.*

*Cooler temperatures forecasted in the 6 – 10-day forecast.*

*Resistance at $2.80.*

*PG&E and SoCal Basis prices are both up today as well. *

*The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 41Bcf. The actual number comes in at 57Bcf. We're now 445Bcf higher than this time last year and 203Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,002Bcf. At 3,205Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. End of Injection Season level forecast falls to 3.80Tcf. Bullish, in my opinion.*
