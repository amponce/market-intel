NYMEX remains flat from yesterday, trying to figure out whether it’s a bull or a bear. Not sure how NYMEX remains at the current price with so much heat coming in.

One thing that knows it’s a bull today is SoCal CG Basis. SoCal CG Basis is up over $12.00 at the time of this report. The reason – unscheduled maintenance on the Wheeler pipeline reduces capacity by 650,000MMBtu/D now through August 11, 2023 (the current timeframe for completion). PG&E CG Basis hasn’t been moving much over the past few days.

Quick note for the power sector people on here – excess power to the grid here in the Golden State is below 5%. Rolling blackouts and brownouts are just a light switch (up) away.….
