NYMEX is down about a dime so far today for the balance of Cal 2023.

PG&E CG Basis is up today while SoCal CG falls further.

Tomorrow’s early storage report estimate is an injection of 54Bcf. Compare that to 59Bcf last year and 55Bcf for the 5-year average. The “experts’ are saying we should expect below average injections for the balance of July/early August. That’s bullish.
