BUSY DAY! Playing catch up!

Today’s storage report estimate was 54Bcf. We had 59Bcf last year and 55Bcf for the 5-year average. The Storage Report comes in with a measly 46Bcf injection. We’re 569Bcf above last year at this time and 364Bcf above the 5-year average for this week. We remain 15% above the 5-year average.

Regarding production/supply and demand, Barchart summed it up well this morning, “Nat-gas prices continue to be undercut by high inventories caused by weak heating demand during the abnormally mild winter. This past winter's warm temps caused nat-gas inventories to rise in Europe and the United States. Gas storage across Europe was 80% full as of July 9, well above the 5-year seasonal average of 65% full for this time of year. Last Friday's weekly EIA report of +72Bcf for the week ended June 30 was bearish for nat-gas prices since it was above the market estimate of +65Bcf and the 5-year average increase for the week of +64Bcf.”

NYMEX reacted to the Storage Report with prices going red from Aug ’23 through April ’25. Pair that with the $0.10 drop yesterday and we’re doing far better than we should be with heatwaves still hitting parts of the US. A cooler shift in the weather forecast (for Central and Eastern regions) is applying downward pressure to NYMEX prices right now.

PG&E CG Basis and SoCal CG Basis are pretty much flat form yesterday.

Next week is going to be hot here in the West so let’s lock up any open positions for July BALMO and Aug ’23 this week.
