NYMEX is up after the storage injection report comes in below estimates. The estimate was 83Bcf. The actual injection was 76Bcf. We're now 566Bcf above last year and 358Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,447Bcf.



The front 3 months remain below $3.00 for NYMEX. After that, we are back in the $3.00 range. We may be out of luck for the remainder of the summer when it comes to hedging cheap NYMEX gas. Next bear run; we need to take advantage of it because it won't last.



Both PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis are up most months.
