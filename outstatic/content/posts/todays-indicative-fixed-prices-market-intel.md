NYMEX prices are down again today, as much as $0.06 for the prompt month, moving as low as $2.49 and as high as $2.59 at the time of this report. We’re down $0.15 from 1 week ago and down $7.18 from 1 year ago.

Bulls – few to none right now. Resistance at $2.60 - $2.70.

Bears – growing every day. We’ve broken the $2.50 mark. If we break the low end of support, and it will take some doing, we could see NYMEX prices fall to and below $2.20. Support at $2.50 - $2.36.

PG&E Basis and SoCal Basis are also down today, ranging from $0.05 to $0.15, depending on the month.

Early estimate for tomorrow’s storage injection comes in at 29Bcf. Compare that to 54Bcf last year and to the 5-year average of 49Bcf. So, last year we had nearly double the injection as expected tomorrow and natgas was $7.00 higher than current market prices…..figure that one out.
