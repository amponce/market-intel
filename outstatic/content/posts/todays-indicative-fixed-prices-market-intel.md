The Storage Report posted a 14Bcf injection. The forecast was 18Bcf. Last year’s injection was 37Bcf. The 5-year average for this week is also 37Bcf. As you can imagine, NYMEX prices jumped up after the announcement earlier this morning. NYMEX is up as much as $0.10 so far today, sitting at $2.58. $

Resistance ranges from $2.54 to $2.65. Support is $2.35 to $2.45. NYMEX still looks good as we are well below last year’s prices and the first month showing at above the $4.00 mark is Dec ’24. Still good buys out there for NYMEX.

Both PG&E CG Basis and SoCal CG Basis prices are up this morning, ranging from $0.03 to $0.10. Today is not the day for Basis. Tomorrow probably won’t be the day either for Basis as we wait out the bullish factors. Sit back, take a breath. Our chance will be here soon enough. Call us to discuss the best options available because there are some very nice options right now.
