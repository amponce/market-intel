6-7-23

NYMEX is up for the 3rd straight day. It seems NYMEX is trying to find a direction right now. Have we bottomed out on NYMEX? Maybe tomorrow’s storage injection will give it NYMEX direction, up or down. The latest storage injection forecast is 115Bcf. Compare that to 99Bcf last year and the 5-year average of 100Bcf for this time of year.

Production falls under 100Bcf/D.

Weather forecasts remain favorable. However, one new factor that could increase cooling demand right now is Canadian wildfire smoke forcing people to close windows and turn on AC units from the Great Lakes region all the way across to New England.

Both PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis are up as well so far this week. Overall, all delivery point fixed prices are higher today than they were 1 week ago.
