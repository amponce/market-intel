NYMEX prices are down today, as much as $0.09 on the prompt month, moving as low as $2.52 and as high as $2.63. We’re down $0.23 from 1 week ago and down $6.70 from 1 year ago. If the prompt month continues to hold this curr3nt price, it will be the biggest decline in price over 1 week since early May ’23. A sure sign we could be very close to shoulder season discounts. For both NYMEX and Basis, patience is the play right now.

Bulls – Short term demand on a shrinking heatwave. Resistance at $2.69 - $2.80.

Bears – Remains the same - 103Bcf/D production and lower than expected LNG exports. Support at $2.524 - $2.47.

We could see a drop in natural gas demand for power generation this weekend as Baja California and SoCal ready for Hurricane Hillary.
