Enjoying the current bull run??

NYMEX is up $0.15 from a week ago but down $5.20 from 1 year ago. Prompt month sits at $2.77 currently, hitting $2.79 briefly. The resistance sits at $2.80 - $2.88. Support levels are now at $2.70 - $2.64.

Basis here in the Golden State is roughly $1.00 from a week ago for both PG&E CG and SoCal CG.

Weather and a drop in end of injection season overall storage are ushing prices up. Weather will weaken but a falling storage level going into winter could bring out more bulls.
