*FACT - If Texas were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest natural gas producer. Now onto today’s market and indictive pricing…*

*NYMEX is moving as low as $2.58 and as high as $2.65 so far today. So, flat for the day. Maybe tomorrow’s Storage Report will give NYMEX more direction.*

*Both PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis are gaining strength today.*

*Current and forecasted weather and demand continue to be the driving factors for both NYMEX and Basis prices.*
