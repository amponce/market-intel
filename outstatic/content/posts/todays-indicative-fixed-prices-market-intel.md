7-28-23

NYMEX is down approximately $0.15 from 1 week ago and down nearly $6.20 from 1 year ago. Aug ’23 is out as prompt month and Sep ’23 steps into the prompt month role, bouncing between $2.56 and $2.68. Resistance at $2.71 - $2.76. Support at $2.54 - $2.66. We’re smack in the middle of that support line right now. With cooler temperatures pushing through from the West in a few days, we could see further bearish pricing to start next week as Bid week winds down.

PG&E CG Basis falls a few cents as cooler temperatures are just a few days away in the West. SoCal CG is down for a second straight day after Wednesday’s massive run up. Aug ’23 delivered is going for just over $10.25. SoCalGas confirmed the unscheduled maintenance on the Wheeler pipeline (dropping daily capacity by 650,000MMBtu) should be completed by 8-11-23.

Have an awesome weekend!
