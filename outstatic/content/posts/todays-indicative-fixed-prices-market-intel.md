NYMEX prices are down today, as much as $0.15 on the prompt month, Oct ’23 down $0.12, Nov ’23 down $0.08, with red posting all the all the way out through May ’25. Down $0.05 from 1 week ago and down $6.00 from 1 year ago.

Let’s review the bulls & bears right now…

Bulls - Weather and Demand. Resistance at $2.86 - $2.90.

Bears - 101Bcf/D production and lower than expected LNG exports. Support at $2.67 - $2.62. We’re on the cusp right now.

PG&E CG Basis is down from yesterday but is up from 1 week ago. Same for SoCal CG Basis.

Prices could fall as the heatwave shrinks in size and severity in the 10 - 15-day forecast.
