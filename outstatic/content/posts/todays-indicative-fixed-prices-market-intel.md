June is coming to an end and with it, the below normal weather conditions being enjoyed by most of the U.S. Texas is a furnace and will remain a furnace for the next week. ERCOT is being tested.

Most of the Midwest will see normal to above normal temps. The West receives the first heatwave of the summer by week’s end.

NYMEX is roughly 5% higher than a week ago.

Yesterday, PG&E CG and SoCal CG Basis prices surged. PG&E CG has backed off some while SoCal CG Basis really fell off, as much as $0.70 for the prompt month.

These are prime examples of how quickly the market can shift. Conditions are relatively favorable right now. What happens when conditions turn unfavorable?
