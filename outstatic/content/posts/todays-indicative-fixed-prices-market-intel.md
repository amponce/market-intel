*9-6-23*

*NYMEX is down again this morning, opening at $2.58, going as high as $2.61, as low as $2.50, currently sitting at $2.54. We’re seeing red all the way out through Dec ’35. Currently NYMEX prompt month is trending below the 9 day, 20 day, and 50 day average of $2.65. If we are able to hold below that average, we could see further downward pressure on NYMEX prices.*

*NYMEX prices are down approximately $0.06 from 1 week ago and down approximately $6.25 from 1 year ago. *

*Current temperatures stay well above normal. Cooler temps forecasted in the 6 – 10-day forecast may be responsible for the downward pressure on NYMEX pricing right now. *

*Resistance at $2.61 - $2.76.*

*Support at $2.53 - $2.47.*

*NatGas averages for last week: Production averaging 102.8 BCF/D. Total Demand averaging 99.9 BCF/D.*

*PG&E and SoCal delivery points continue to weaken but not at the downward pace many of us anticipated after the Aliso Canyon got the green light to go from 41Bcf to 68Bcf for this winter. *
