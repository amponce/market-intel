8-2-23

NYMEX is down approximately $0.25 from 1 week ago and down nearly $6.00 from 1 year ago. Sep ’23 is down again today, opening today at $2.56 and falling to $2.46 at the time of this report. Every month past Sep ’23 and through Dec ’35 is seeing red today. Resistance ranges from $2.67 to $2.75. Support is $2.49 to $2.39. And we’ve hit the top end of that support today already.

Short- and longer-term PG&E CG Basis prices are up compared to 1 week ago. SoCal CG Basis prices are falling as cooler, less humid weather returns to the <s>tarnished</s>

 Golden State as well as unscheduled maintenance on the Wheeler pipeline is set to be completed by 8-11-23, on schedule.

It is my belief that we could see prices fall further as we move into the shoulder months; moving out of summer, away from summer heat, causing demand to fall, while production stays steady (around 100Bcf/D) or increases, and before winter heating demand days kick in.

The latest Storage Report is forecasted to show an 18Bcf injection. Compare this to last year and the 5-year average, 37Bcf for both. Extreme heat in July is responsible for this well below normal injection. If it comes in above the forecasted 18Bcf, we could see NYMEX continue the current downward trend….
