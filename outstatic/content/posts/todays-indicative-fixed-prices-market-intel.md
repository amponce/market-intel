5-25-23

The latest storage injection forecast was for 101Bcf. The actual number comes in at 96Bcf. We're now 529Bcf higher than this time last year and 340Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,996Bcf. At 2,336Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range.

BTW, the “experts” are projecting storage levels to be at 4Tcf by the end of this storage injection season.

Wildfires in Western Canada continue to limit Canadian natgas exports to the US. We’re currently receiving approximately 5Bcf/D, compared to the usual 9Bcf/D we receive from our gracious neighbors to the north.

Daily US production continues to be just over 100Bcf/D so far this week.

Demand hovers around 90Bcf/D. This number is below average for this time of year.

So, what is NYMEX doing after hearing all this?? NYMEX prices are down as much as $0.11 on the prompt month, as well as showing red all the way through April ’25.

PG&E CG Basis fell by as much as $0.20 from yesterday’s indicatives. You can execute 12-month strips (with pretty much any start month over the next 16 months) at/under $6.00 per MMBtu. This price range is the cheapest we’ve seen in many months for PG&E CG. Let’s lock it up before it disappears. #PG&ECGBasisFalling

SoCal CG Basis is moving up and down within the $0.05 range so far today. Could this be because SoCalGas continues to plod along or are they simply exhibiting that legendary SoCalGas due diligence in their pipeline maintenance? I’ll take the prior over the latter. #HurryUpSoCalGas
