8-25-23

The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 29Bcf. The actual number comes in at 18Bcf. We're now 513Bcf higher than this time last year and 268Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,815Bcf. At 3,083Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-year historical range. Compare that to 54Bcf last year and to the 5-year average of 49Bcf. So, last year we had nearly double the injection as expected than yesterday and natgas was nearly $7.00 higher than current market prices…..figure that one out.

End of Injection Season level forecast remains at 3.90Tcf, down from the earlier forecast of 4.1Tcf.

CPUC is trying to increase Aliso Canyon storage for this winter from 41Bcf to 68Bcf. The vote will be announced 8-31-23.

NYMEX prompt month opened at $2.51, has been up to $2.54, as low as $2.46, and is currently back at the opening price. We’re down $0.10 from 1 week ago and down $6.80 from 1 year ago. Forward months and winter strips re both up a few cents today.

Resistance at $2.75 - $2.82.

Support at $2.52 - $2.48.

Far more bears than bulls right now.

PG&E Basis and SoCal Basis are still moving down, penny by penny.
