NYMEX is down approximately $0.12 from 1 week ago, and down $3.15 from 1 year ago. Production is back over 101Bcf/D. That’s a good thing since we just went through one of the hottest Independence Day Holiday weekends in years.

The current 10-day forecast is calling for below normal temps for4 the Plains and Great lakes regions. The SW, Texas, and Gulf regions remain above normal with no great relief Texas is almost done with their most recent heat dome and that gives a well needed ease in power generation demand. All this gives people who are looking to hedge NYMEX (and you should be looking to hedge) an added discount. Get on it.
