NYMEX certainly chose a direction this morning after the EIA released the latest Storage Report. The estimate was a measly 45Bcf. The actual injection came in at an even measlier 41Bcf. Pair that with an extended heatwave for most o the U.S. over the next 2 weeks. Now sitting just above $2.75 for the prompt month, bulls are running. Bears won’t be seen until a downward correction below $2.55 takes place. We can expect both NYMEX and West region Basis to continue this bull run as long as the driving factors remain the same.
