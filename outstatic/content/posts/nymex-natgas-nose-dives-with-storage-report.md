***THE One Minute Energy Update for 8-22-24***

***Today’s highlights -***  

*. NatGas spot prices are down at most major delivery points.  This is a change in direction from earlier in the week when TX and CA were bringing bullish support.*

*. Top producers (EQT for one) expect to cut more production once we enter Autumn.  The storage surplus is the reason.* 

*. Storage is dwindling due to 3 straight poor storage reports.* 

*. NYMEX NatGas nose dives with storage report.*

***#CARBONOFFSETS –*** *California and other states will be mandating companies buy carbon offsets, starting as early as 2025.  Is your company ready for that mandate?  Better to get ahead of the 2025 demand – more options, greater price range.  We can help.* 

***THE BOTTOM LINE*** *– We could see a brief bull run for both gas and power for the next 2 weeks, starting as early as tomorrow.  The reasons are weather, fear of shrinking storage going into winter, and an increasing reliance on natgas.*
