***#CARBONOFFSETS –*** *California and other states will be mandating companies buy carbon offsets, starting as early as 2025.  Is your company ready for that mandate?  Better to get ahead of the 2025 demand – more options, greater price range.  We can help.* 

***THE BOTTOM LINE*** *– So far, summer heat really hasn’t shown up, other than a few extreme days.  Production continues to increase but so do LNG and Mexico exports (combining for approximately 20Bcf/D that could be going into domestic pipes or storage – as an esteemed colleague pointed out in conversation – tip of the cap to you C.R.).  NYMEX prices are great right now.  Basis is cheap on the daily spot.  Winter is coming and all we need is a mention of “polar”, “extreme”, “severe”, or any other bull related word, and prices could run hard on us.  It just takes 1 bad month to wipe out a year of good prices.  On the flip side, if we go through this winter with the current forecasts, we could see prices tank in Feb ‘25/march ’25.  The market could go either way, as it has a habit of doing.  So, let’s talk and determine what the best strategy for each of you is.*
