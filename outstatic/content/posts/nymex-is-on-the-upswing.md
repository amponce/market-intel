The rest of the US will be comfortable as weather systems track through with showers and highs of 60s to lower 80s..*

***CARBON OFFSETS –*** *We have carbon offset offerings as low as $1 per unit to $375 per unit.  You will find the perfect carbon offset to fit your carbon footprint recovery.* 

***THE BOTTOM LINE*** *– Production is down.  LNG exports are up.  Summer weather forecasts are bullish and pushing up anticipated natural gas demand for power generation to meet increased cooling demand.  Despite these bullish factors, summer and 2024 balance of the year prices are decent.  We should take advantage of current pricing for the balance of 2024, if we haven’t already.  Or you can wait, gamble on the market, and see what happens.*
