***#CARBONOFFSETS –*** *California and other states will be mandating companies buy carbon offsets, starting as early as 2025.  Is your company ready for that mandate?  Better to get ahead of the 2025 demand – more options, greater price range.  We can help.* 

***THE BOTTOM LINE*** *– Be patient.  The weather will move prices up and down over the next few weeks.  Then, we should see downward pressure as traders turn their focus to winter.  Then we can take advantage of the expected fall.  Longer term strips let’s lock them over the next few weeks.*

***RFP ES is now providing energy in WA, OR, CA, NV, AR, NM, (parts of) TX, PJM region, Mid-Con region, Gulf States region, NC, and VA.  So, going forward, rather than having a massive indicative daily pricing sheet (that changes by the minute), we will simply quote any requests you may have on an individual basis.  We will still report on NYMEX and Western Region Basis movement.***       

***ALSO – If you would like an indicative/executable quote, you can simply go to [RFPES.com](http://RFPES.com) and submit a Request for Proposal (RFP).  THE RFP will be sent to all our supply partners who are supplying energy in that region.  You choose the time and date you would like to receive the quote – please give 48 hours from the time you submit to the time you want to receive the quote.  It takes less than 5 minutes to submit a request for proposal.***
