***SUPPORT*** *- Starting @ $2.52/$2.41.* 

***BASIS*** *– Both PG&E CG Basis SoCal Basis daily spot and day ahead prices are up today, most likely due to triple digit temps in the SW.*

The rest of the southern 1/3 of the US will be warm to hot w/highs of 80s and 90s, locally 100s Southwest. The northern 2/3 of the US will be comfortable w/highs of 60s-80s, besides briefly near 90 Ohio Valley Monday and cooler 50s over the N.

***CARBON OFFSETS –*** *We have carbon offset offerings as low as $1 per unit to $375 per unit.  You will find the perfect carbon offset to fit your carbon footprint recovery.* 

***THE BOTTOM LINE*** *– NYMEX is racing towards the $3.00 mark.  It is summer.  Demand is increasing and will increase further.  The current price range and increasing demand may push producers to increase daily production.  LNG is also up.   The driving factors are bullish.  Don’t expect any NYMEX fire sales to take place any time soon.  For those who are locked, good job.  For those who didn’t lock….we’ll see how it plays out.*
