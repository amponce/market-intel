5-26-23

First and foremost, we want to wish everyone a peaceful and reflective Memorial Day Weekend.

Thank you to all who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.

NYMEX is down around $0.35 from a week ago and is down approximately $6.75 from one year ago. This downward movement is due to cooler than normal temperatures across most of the republic for the next few weeks.

PG&E CG Basis is down AGAIN today.

SoCal CG Basis is a mess. We have forward SoCal CG delivered prices going for over $9 for some months while the daily spot price is under $2.00. The one thing keeping the spread so wide is simple – SoCalGas Company’s inability to instill any confidence that capacity/storage/optionality will return to historical levels any time soon. It’s the kickoff to summer and SoCalGas already has its head buried in the sand.
