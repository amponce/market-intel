*10/2/23*

*Estimated First of the Month Index Prices:*

*SoCal Bdr = $2.71*

*SoCal CG = $4.15*

*PG&E CG = $4.21*

*For those of you who are fine with buying SoCal CG over SoCal Border, because you think the $0.55 BTS doesn’t move, you’re 100% wrong. For Oct ’23, you’re paying an additional $0.89 ($1.44 for BTS instead of $0.55) for Oct ’23. E.g., 1,000MMBtu/D at CG is costing you an additional $45,000 for Oct ’23 alone. For 2023, not including Oct ’23, you are averaging an additional $3.11 per MMBtu by buying SoCal CG. Let that sink in……*
