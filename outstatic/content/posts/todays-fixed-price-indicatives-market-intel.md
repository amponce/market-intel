*8-31-23*

*Before we jump into today’s market, we want to wish all of you hard working people a very peaceful, very restful, and a very Happy Labor Day Weekend. We’ll be around for a few hours tomorrow, up until NYMEX closes. We will be closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day, and we’ll pick it up again on Tuesday with a fresh edition of THE Energy Update. Now…. on to today’s update.*

*The most recent forecast for storage was an injection of 30Bcf. The actual injection is 32Bcf. NYMEX is reacting with a slight uptick. The prompt month opened at $2.80, fell to $2.70, and sits at $2.83 at the time of this update. NYMEX is up for the third straight day.*

*Oct ’23 is now prompt month and it’s up as much as $0.17 in the past 2 days. Weather is the driving factor right now. We’re up $0.25 from 1 week ago and down $6.20 from 1 year ago. *

*Resistance at $2.78 - $2.84.*

*Support at $2.64 - $2.56. *

*The 6–10 day weather forecast is pushing NYMEX up and pushing CA Basis down. More bulls than bears today. We should see NYMEX weaken after this current heatwave rolls through the U.S., about 2 weeks out.*

*We’re supposed to find out today if Aliso Canyon will be allowed to increase the winter storage from 41Bcf to 68Bcf. We’ll keep you posted.*
