8-30-23

Oct ’23 is now prompt month and it’s up as much as $0.17 in the past 2 days. Weather is the driving factor right now. We’re up $0.10 from 1 week ago and down $6.70 from 1 year ago. Oct ’23 currently sits at $2.75, smack dab in the middle of bullish resistance.

Resistance at $2.72 - $2.78.

Support at $2.56 - $2.48.

More bulls than bears today. But we know all too well that in this market, that could flip at any time, and flip again, and then flip back, then flip again, and…. I think I’ve made my point.

PG&E Basis and SoCal Basis continue to weaken penny by penny as we eagerly await voting results tomorrow on CPUC’s request to increase storage at Aliso Canyon, for this winter, from 41Bcf to 68Bcf. In my opinion, it should pass and here’s why I believe it will - it’s political. There’s a certain guy that will be running for president in a few months, and he already has enough explaining to do on how he screwed up California.

The most recent forecast for storage is an injection of 30Bcf. Compare that to 61Bcf 1 year ago and 51Bcf for the 5-year average.
