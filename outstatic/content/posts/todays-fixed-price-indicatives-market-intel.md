*9-1-23*

*In case you haven’t heard, the CPUC voted 5-0 in favor of increasing the storage from 41Bcf to 68Bc, at Aliso Canyon, for this coming winter, in hopes of lessening the growing volatility in the Basis market here in the Southland. So far, basis prices have had no reaction downward to this wonderful news. We’ll see what happens after this Labor Day Weekend. *

*The prompt month opened at $2.76, fell to $2.73, ran as high as $2.86, and sits at $2.82 at the time of this update. NYMEX is up for the fourth straight day.*

*Oct ’23 is now prompt month and it’s up as much as $0.17 in the past 2 days. Weather is the driving factor right now. We’re up $0.25 from 1 week ago and down $6.20 from 1 year ago. *

*Resistance at $2.78 - $2.84.*

*Support at $2.69 - $2.61. *

*Happy Labor Day Weekend to all those people who make the choice to get up every day and put in the effort.*
